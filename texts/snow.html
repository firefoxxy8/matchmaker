    <div id="line-3" title="line-3" class="stanza_line">THE THREE stood listening to a fresh access</div>
    <div id="line-4" title="line-4" class="stanza_line">Of wind that caught against the house a moment,</div>
    <div id="line-5" title="line-5" class="stanza_line">Gulped snow, and then blew free again—the Coles</div>
    <div id="line-6" title="line-6" class="stanza_line">Dressed, but dishevelled from some hours of sleep,</div>
    <div id="line-7" title="line-7" class="stanza_line">Meserve belittled in the great skin coat he wore.</div>
    <div id="line-8" title="line-8" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-9" title="line-9" class="stanza_line">Meserve was first to speak. He pointed backward</div>
    <div id="line-10" title="line-10" class="stanza_line">Over his shoulder with his pipe-stem, saying,</div>
    <div id="line-11" title="line-11" class="stanza_line">“You can just see it glancing off the roof</div>
    <div id="line-12" title="line-12" class="stanza_line">Making a great scroll upward toward the sky,</div>
    <div id="line-13" title="line-13" class="stanza_line">Long enough for recording all our names on.—</div>
    <div id="line-14" title="line-14" class="stanza_line">I think I’ll just call up my wife and tell her</div>
    <div id="line-15" title="line-15" class="stanza_line">I’m here—so far—and starting on again.</div>
    <div id="line-16" title="line-16" class="stanza_line">I’ll call her softly so that if she’s wise</div>
    <div id="line-17" title="line-17" class="stanza_line">And gone to sleep, she needn’t wake to answer.”</div>
    <div id="line-18" title="line-18" class="stanza_line">Three times he barely stirred the bell, then listened.</div>
    <div id="line-19" title="line-19" class="stanza_line">“Why, Lett, still up? Lett, I’m at Cole’s. I’m late.</div>
    <div id="line-20" title="line-20" class="stanza_line">I called you up to say Good-night from here</div>
    <div id="line-21" title="line-21" class="stanza_line">Before I went to say Good-morning there.—</div>
    <div id="line-22" title="line-22" class="stanza_line">I thought I would.— I know, but, Lett—I know—</div>
    <div id="line-23" title="line-23" class="stanza_line">I could, but what’s the sense? The rest won’t be</div>
    <div id="line-24" title="line-24" class="stanza_line">So bad.— Give me an hour for it.— Ho, ho,</div>
    <div id="line-25" title="line-25" class="stanza_line">Three hours to here! But that was all up hill;</div>
    <div id="line-26" title="line-26" class="stanza_line">The rest is down.— Why no, no, not a wallow:</div>
    <div id="line-27" title="line-27" class="stanza_line">They kept their heads and took their time to it</div>
    <div id="line-28" title="line-28" class="stanza_line">Like darlings, both of them. They’re in the barn.—</div>
    <div id="line-29" title="line-29" class="stanza_line">My dear, I’m coming just the same. I didn’t</div>
    <div id="line-30" title="line-30" class="stanza_line">Call you to ask you to invite me home.—”</div>
    <div id="line-31" title="line-31" class="stanza_line">He lingered for some word she wouldn’t say,</div>
    <div id="line-32" title="line-32" class="stanza_line">Said it at last himself, “Good-night,” and then,</div>
    <div id="line-33" title="line-33" class="stanza_line">Getting no answer, closed the telephone.</div>
    <div id="line-34" title="line-34" class="stanza_line">The three stood in the lamplight round the table</div>
    <div id="line-35" title="line-35" class="stanza_line">With lowered eyes a moment till he said,</div>
    <div id="line-36" title="line-36" class="stanza_line">“I’ll just see how the horses are.”</div>
    <div id="line-37" title="line-37" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-38" title="line-38" class="stanza_line">“Yes, do,”</div>
    <div id="line-39" title="line-39" class="stanza_line">Both the Coles said together. Mrs. Cole</div>
    <div id="line-40" title="line-40" class="stanza_line">Added: “You can judge better after seeing.—</div>
    <div id="line-41" title="line-41" class="stanza_line">I want you here with me, Fred. Leave him here,</div>
    <div id="line-42" title="line-42" class="stanza_line">Brother Meserve. You know to find your way</div>
    <div id="line-43" title="line-43" class="stanza_line">Out through the shed.”</div>
    <div id="line-44" title="line-44" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-45" title="line-45" class="stanza_line">“I guess I know my way,</div>
    <div id="line-46" title="line-46" class="stanza_line">I guess I know where I can find my name</div>
    <div id="line-47" title="line-47" class="stanza_line">Carved in the shed to tell me who I am</div>
    <div id="line-48" title="line-48" class="stanza_line">If it don’t tell me where I am. I used</div>
    <div id="line-49" title="line-49" class="stanza_line">To play—”</div>
    <div id="line-50" title="line-50" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-51" title="line-51" class="stanza_line">“You tend your horses and come back.</div>
    <div id="line-52" title="line-52" class="stanza_line">Fred Cole, you’re going to let him!”</div>
    <div id="line-53" title="line-53" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-54" title="line-54" class="stanza_line">“Well, aren’t you?</div>
    <div id="line-55" title="line-55" class="stanza_line">How can you help yourself?”</div>
    <div id="line-56" title="line-56" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-57" title="line-57" class="stanza_line">“I called him Brother.</div>
    <div id="line-58" title="line-58" class="stanza_line">Why did I call him that?”</div>
    <div id="line-59" title="line-59" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-60" title="line-60" class="stanza_line">“It’s right enough.</div>
    <div id="line-61" title="line-61" class="stanza_line">That’s all you ever heard him called round here.</div>
    <div id="line-62" title="line-62" class="stanza_line">He seems to have lost off his Christian name.”</div>
    <div id="line-63" title="line-63" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-64" title="line-64" class="stanza_line">“Christian enough I should call that myself.</div>
    <div id="line-65" title="line-65" class="stanza_line">He took no notice, did he? Well, at least</div>
    <div id="line-66" title="line-66" class="stanza_line">I didn’t use it out of love of him,</div>
    <div id="line-67" title="line-67" class="stanza_line">The dear knows. I detest the thought of him</div>
    <div id="line-68" title="line-68" class="stanza_line">With his ten children under ten years old.</div>
    <div id="line-69" title="line-69" class="stanza_line">I hate his wretched little Racker Sect,</div>
    <div id="line-70" title="line-70" class="stanza_line">All’s ever I heard of it, which isn’t much.</div>
    <div id="line-71" title="line-71" class="stanza_line">But that’s not saying—Look, Fred Cole, it’s twelve,</div>
    <div id="line-72" title="line-72" class="stanza_line">Isn’t it, now? He’s been here half an hour.</div>
    <div id="line-73" title="line-73" class="stanza_line">He says he left the village store at nine.</div>
    <div id="line-74" title="line-74" class="stanza_line">Three hours to do four miles—a mile an hour</div>
    <div id="line-75" title="line-75" class="stanza_line">Or not much better. Why, it doesn’t seem</div>
    <div id="line-76" title="line-76" class="stanza_line">As if a man could move that slow and move.</div>
    <div id="line-77" title="line-77" class="stanza_line">Try to think what he did with all that time.</div>
    <div id="line-78" title="line-78" class="stanza_line">And three miles more to go!”</div>
    <div id="line-79" title="line-79" class="stanza_line">“Don’t let him go.</div>
    <div id="line-80" title="line-80" class="stanza_line">Stick to him, Helen. Make him answer you.</div>
    <div id="line-81" title="line-81" class="stanza_line">That sort of man talks straight on all his life</div>
    <div id="line-82" title="line-82" class="stanza_line">From the last thing he said himself, stone deaf</div>
    <div id="line-83" title="line-83" class="stanza_line">To anything anyone else may say.</div>
    <div id="line-84" title="line-84" class="stanza_line">I should have thought, though, you could make him hear you.”</div>
    <div id="line-85" title="line-85" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-86" title="line-86" class="stanza_line">“What is he doing out a night like this?</div>
    <div id="line-87" title="line-87" class="stanza_line">Why can’t he stay at home?”</div>
    <div id="line-88" title="line-88" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-89" title="line-89" class="stanza_line">“He had to preach.”</div>

    <div id="line-93" title="line-93" class="stanza_line">“He may be small,</div>
    <div id="line-94" title="line-94" class="stanza_line">He may be good, but one thing’s sure, he’s tough.”</div>
    <div id="line-95" title="line-95" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-96" title="line-96" class="stanza_line">“And strong of stale tobacco.”</div>

    <div id="line-98" title="line-98" class="stanza_line">“He’ll pull through.’</div>
    <div id="line-99" title="line-99" class="stanza_line">“You only say so. Not another house</div>
    <div id="line-100" title="line-100" class="stanza_line">Or shelter to put into from this place</div>
    <div id="line-101" title="line-101" class="stanza_line">To theirs. I’m going to call his wife again.”</div>
    <div id="line-102" title="line-102" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-103" title="line-103" class="stanza_line">“Wait and he may. Let’s see what he will do.</div>
    <div id="line-104" title="line-104" class="stanza_line">Let’s see if he will think of her again.</div>
    <div id="line-105" title="line-105" class="stanza_line">But then I doubt he’s thinking of himself</div>
    <div id="line-106" title="line-106" class="stanza_line">He doesn’t look on it as anything.”</div>
    <div id="line-107" title="line-107" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>

    <div id="line-111" title="line-111" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-112" title="line-112" class="stanza_line">“One thing: he didn’t drag God into it.”</div>

    <div id="line-116" title="line-116" class="stanza_line">“You think so, do you? You don’t know the kind.</div>
    <div id="line-117" title="line-117" class="stanza_line">He’s getting up a miracle this minute.</div>
    <div id="line-118" title="line-118" class="stanza_line">Privately—to himself, right now, he’s thinking</div>
    <div id="line-119" title="line-119" class="stanza_line">He’ll make a case of it if he succeeds,</div>
    <div id="line-120" title="line-120" class="stanza_line">But keep still if he fails.”</div>

    <div id="line-143" title="line-143" class="stanza_line">Only you women have to put these airs on</div>
    <div id="line-144" title="line-144" class="stanza_line">To impress men. You’ve got us so ashamed</div>
    <div id="line-145" title="line-145" class="stanza_line">Of being men we can’t look at a good fight</div>
    <div id="line-146" title="line-146" class="stanza_line">Between two boys and not feel bound to stop it.</div>
    <div id="line-147" title="line-147" class="stanza_line">Let the man freeze an ear or two, I say.—</div>

    <div id="line-165" title="line-165" class="stanza_line">Like a white crumpled spider on his knee:</div>
    <div id="line-166" title="line-166" class="stanza_line">“That leaf there in your open book! It moved</div>
    <div id="line-167" title="line-167" class="stanza_line">Just then, I thought. It’s stood erect like that,</div>
    <div id="line-168" title="line-168" class="stanza_line">There on the table, ever since I came,</div>
    <div id="line-169" title="line-169" class="stanza_line">Trying to turn itself backward or forward,</div>
    <div id="line-170" title="line-170" class="stanza_line">I’ve had my eye on it to make out which;</div>

    <div id="line-174" title="line-174" class="stanza_line">It’s from regret for something you have passed</div>
    <div id="line-175" title="line-175" class="stanza_line">And failed to see the good of. Never mind,</div>

    <div id="line-178" title="line-178" class="stanza_line">That varies with the things—before we see them.</div>
    <div id="line-179" title="line-179" class="stanza_line">One of the lies would make it out that nothing</div>

    <div id="line-189" title="line-189" class="stanza_line">A thing as that. It couldn’t reach the lamp</div>
    <div id="line-190" title="line-190" class="stanza_line">To get a puff of black smoke from the flame,</div>
    <div id="line-191" title="line-191" class="stanza_line">Or blow a rumple in the collie’s coat.</div>

    <div id="line-410" title="line-410" class="stanza_line">You don’t suppose—? She wouldn’t go out doors?”</div>
    <div id="line-411" title="line-411" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-412" title="line-412" class="stanza_line">“I’m half afraid that’s just what she might do.”</div>

    <div id="line-414" title="line-414" class="stanza_line">“And leave the children?”</div>

    <div id="line-418" title="line-418" class="stanza_line">Wide open and the wind’s blown out the lamp</div>
    <div id="line-419" title="line-419" class="stanza_line">And the fire’s died and the room’s dark and cold?”</div>
    <div id="line-420" title="line-420" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-421" title="line-421" class="stanza_line">“One of two things, either she’s gone to bed</div>
    <div id="line-422" title="line-422" class="stanza_line">Or gone out doors.”</div>

    <div id="line-426" title="line-426" class="stanza_line">It’s strange she doesn’t want to speak to us.”</div>
    <div id="line-427" title="line-427" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-428" title="line-428" class="stanza_line">“Fred, see if you can hear what I hear. Come.”</div>
    <div id="line-429" title="line-429" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-430" title="line-430" class="stanza_line">“A clock maybe.”</div>
    <div id="line-431" title="line-431" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-432" title="line-432" class="stanza_line">“Don’t you hear something else?”</div>
    <div id="line-433" title="line-433" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-434" title="line-434" class="stanza_line">“Not talking.”</div>
    <div id="line-435" title="line-435" class="stanza_line">“No.”</div>
    <div id="line-436" title="line-436" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-437" title="line-437" class="stanza_line">“Why, yes, I hear—what is it?”</div>
    <div id="line-438" title="line-438" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-439" title="line-439" class="stanza_line">“What do you say it is?”</div>

    <div id="line-441" title="line-441" class="stanza_line">“A baby’s crying!</div>
    <div id="line-442" title="line-442" class="stanza_line">Frantic it sounds, though muffled and far off.”</div>
    <div id="line-443" title="line-443" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-444" title="line-444" class="stanza_line">“Its mother wouldn’t let it cry like that,</div>

    <div id="line-448" title="line-448" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-449" title="line-449" class="stanza_line">“There’s only one thing possible to make,</div>
    <div id="line-450" title="line-450" class="stanza_line">That is, assuming—that she has gone out.</div>
    <div id="line-451" title="line-451" class="stanza_line">Of course she hasn’t though.” They both sat down</div>
    <div id="line-452" title="line-452" class="stanza_line">Helpless. “There’s nothing we can do till morning.”</div>
    <div id="line-453" title="line-453" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-454" title="line-454" class="stanza_line">“Fred, I shan’t let you think of going out.”</div>
    <div id="line-455" title="line-455" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-456" title="line-456" class="stanza_line">“Hold on.” The double bell began to chirp.</div>
    <div id="line-457" title="line-457" class="stanza_line">They started up. Fred took the telephone.</div>
    <div id="line-458" title="line-458" class="stanza_line">“Hello, Meserve. You’re there, then!—And your wife?</div>
    <div id="line-459" title="line-459" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-460" title="line-460" class="stanza_line">Good! Why I asked—she didn’t seem to answer.</div>
    <div id="line-461" title="line-461" class="stanza_line">He says she went to let him in the barn.—</div>
    <div id="line-462" title="line-462" class="stanza_line">We’re glad. Oh, say no more about it, man.</div>
    <div id="line-463" title="line-463" class="stanza_line">Drop in and see us when you’re passing.”</div>
    <div id="line-464" title="line-464" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-465" title="line-465" class="stanza_line">“Well,</div>
    <div id="line-466" title="line-466" class="stanza_line">She has him then, though what she wants him for</div>
    <div id="line-467" title="line-467" class="stanza_line">I don’t see.”</div>
    <div id="line-468" title="line-468" class="stanza_line">“Possibly not for herself.</div>
    <div id="line-469" title="line-469" class="stanza_line">Maybe she only wants him for the children.”</div>
    <div id="line-470" title="line-470" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-471" title="line-471" class="stanza_line">“The whole to-do seems to have been for nothing.</div>
    <div id="line-472" title="line-472" class="stanza_line">What spoiled our night was to him just his fun.</div>
    <div id="line-473" title="line-473" class="stanza_line">What did he come in for?—To talk and visit?</div>
    <div id="line-474" title="line-474" class="stanza_line">Thought he’d just call to tell us it was snowing.</div>
    <div id="line-475" title="line-475" class="stanza_line">If he thinks he is going to make our house</div>
    <div id="line-476" title="line-476" class="stanza_line">A halfway coffee house ’twixt town and nowhere——”</div>
    <div id="line-477" title="line-477" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-478" title="line-478" class="stanza_line">“I thought you’d feel you’d been too much concerned.”</div>
    <div id="line-479" title="line-479" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-480" title="line-480" class="stanza_line">“You think you haven’t been concerned yourself.”</div>
    <div id="line-481" title="line-481" class="blank_line">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="line-482" title="line-482" class="stanza_line">“If you mean he was inconsiderate</div>
    <div id="line-483" title="line-483" class="stanza_line">To rout us out to think for him at midnight</div>
    <div id="line-484" title="line-484" class="stanza_line">And then take our advice no more than nothing,</div>
    <div id="line-485" title="line-485" class="stanza_line">Why, I agree with you. But let’s forgive him.</div>
    <div id="line-486" title="line-486" class="stanza_line">We’ve had a share in one night of his life.</div>
    <div id="line-487" title="line-487" class="stanza_line">What’ll you bet he ever calls again?”</div>
