# INFERNO

## Inferno - Canto I

<p id="inferno-i-1">Midway upon the journey of our life  
I found myself within a forest dark,  
For the straightforward pathway had been lost.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-4">Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say
What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,
Which in the very thought renews the fear.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-7">So bitter is it, death is little more;
But of the good to treat, which there I found,
Speak will I of the other things I saw there.</p>

<p id="inferno-i-10">I cannot well repeat how there I entered,
So full was I of slumber at the moment
In which I had abandoned the true way.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-13">But after I had reached a mountain's foot,
At that point where the valley terminated,q
Which had with consternation pierced my heart,
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-16">Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,
Vested already with that planet's rays
Which leadeth others right by every road.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-19">Then was the fear a little quieted
That in my heart's lake had endured throughout
The night, which I had passed so piteously.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-22">And even as he, who, with distressful breath,
Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,
Turns to the water perilous and gazes;
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-25">So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,
Turn itself back to re-behold the pass
Which never yet a living person left.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-28">After my weary body I had rested,
The way resumed I on the desert slope,
So that the firm foot ever was the lower.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-31">And lo! almost where the ascent began,
A panther light and swift exceedingly,
Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-34">And never moved she from before my face,
Nay, rather did impede so much my way,
That many times I to return had turned.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-37">The time was the beginning of the morning,
And up the sun was mounting with those stars
That with him were, what time the Love Divine
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-40">At first in motion set those beauteous things;
So were to me occasion of good hope,
The variegated skin of that wild beast,
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-43">The hour of time, and the delicious season;
But not so much, that did not give me fear
A lion's aspect which appeared to me.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-46">He seemed as if against me he were coming
With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,
So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-49">And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings
Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,
And many folk has caused to live forlorn!
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-52">She brought upon me so much heaviness,
With the affright that from her aspect came,
That I the hope relinquished of the height.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-55">And as he is who willingly acquires,
And the time comes that causes him to lose,
Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-58">E'en such made me that beast withouten peace,
Which, coming on against me by degrees
Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-61">While I was rushing downward to the lowland,
Before mine eyes did one present himself,
Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-64">When I beheld him in the desert vast,
"Have pity on me," unto him I cried,
"Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-67">He answered me: "Not man; man once I was,
And both my parents were of Lombardy,
And Mantuans by country both of them.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-70">'Sub Julio' was I born, though it was late,
And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,
During the time of false and lying gods.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-73">A poet was I, and I sang that just
Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,
After that Ilion the superb was burned.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-76">But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?
Why climb'st thou not the Mount Delectable,
Which is the source and cause of every joy?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-79">"Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain
Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?"
I made response to him with bashful forehead.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-82">"O, of the other poets honour and light,
Avail me the long study and great love
That have impelled me to explore thy volume!
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-85">Thou art my master, and my author thou,
Thou art alone the one from whom I took
The beautiful style that has done honour to me.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-88">Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;
Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,
For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble."
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-91">"Thee it behoves to take another road,"
Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,
"If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-94">Because this beast, at which thou criest out,
Suffers not any one to pass her way,
But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-97">And has a nature so malign and ruthless,
That never doth she glut her greedy will,
And after food is hungrier than before.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-100">Many the animals with whom she weds,
And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound
Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-103">He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,
But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;
'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-106">Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,
On whose account the maid Camilla died,
Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-109">Through every city shall he hunt her down,
Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,
There from whence envy first did let her loose.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-112">Therefore I think and judge it for thy best
Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,
And lead thee hence through the eternal place,
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-115">Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,
Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,
Who cry out each one for the second death;
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-118">And thou shalt see those who contented are
Within the fire, because they hope to come,
Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people;
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-121">To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,
A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;
With her at my departure I will leave thee;
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-124">Because that Emperor, who reigns above,
In that I was rebellious to his law,
Wills that through me none come into his city.
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-127">He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;
There is his city and his lofty throne;
O happy he whom thereto he elects!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-130">And I to him: "Poet, I thee entreat,
By that same God whom thou didst never know,
So that I may escape this woe and worse,
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-133">Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,
That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,
And those thou makest so disconsolate."
</p>

<p id="inferno-i-136">Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto II

<p id="inferno-ii-1">Day was departing, and the embrowned air
Released the animals that are on earth
From their fatigues; and I the only one
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-4">Made myself ready to sustain the war,
Both of the way and likewise of the woe,
Which memory that errs not shall retrace.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-7">O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!
O memory, that didst write down what I saw,
Here thy nobility shall be manifest!
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-10">And I began: "Poet, who guidest me,
Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,
Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-13">Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,
While yet corruptible, unto the world
Immortal went, and was there bodily.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-16">But if the adversary of all evil
Was courteous, thinking of the high effect
That issue would from him, and who, and what,
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-19">To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;
For he was of great Rome, and of her empire
In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-22">The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,
Were stablished as the holy place, wherein
Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-25">Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,
Things did he hear, which the occasion were
Both of his victory and the papal mantle.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-28">Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,
To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,
Which of salvation's way is the beginning.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-31">But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?
I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,
Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-34">Therefore, if I resign myself to come,
I fear the coming may be ill-advised;
Thou'rt wise, and knowest better than I speak."
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-37">And as he is, who unwills what he willed,
And by new thoughts doth his intention change,
So that from his design he quite withdraws,
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-40">Such I became, upon that dark hillside,
Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,
Which was so very prompt in the beginning.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-43">"If I have well thy language understood,"
Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,
"Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-46">Which many times a man encumbers so,
It turns him back from honoured enterprise,
As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-49">That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,
I'll tell thee why I came, and what I heard
At the first moment when I grieved for thee.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-52">Among those was I who are in suspense,
And a fair, saintly Lady called to me
In such wise, I besought her to command me.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-55">Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;
And she began to say, gentle and low,
With voice angelical, in her own language:
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-58">'O spirit courteous of Mantua,
Of whom the fame still in the world endures,
And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-61">A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,
Upon the desert slope is so impeded
Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-64">And may, I fear, already be so lost,
That I too late have risen to his succour,
From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-67">Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,
And with what needful is for his release,
Assist him so, that I may be consoled.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-70">Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;
I come from there, where I would fain return;
Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-73">When I shall be in presence of my Lord,
Full often will I praise thee unto him.'
Then paused she, and thereafter I began:
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-76">'O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom
The human race exceedeth all contained
Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-79">So grateful unto me is thy commandment,
To obey, if 'twere already done, were late;
No farther need'st thou ope to me thy wish.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-82">But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun
The here descending down into this centre,
From the vast place thou burnest to return to.'
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-85">'Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,
Briefly will I relate,' she answered me,
'Why I am not afraid to enter here.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-88">Of those things only should one be afraid
Which have the power of doing others harm;
Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-91">God in his mercy such created me
That misery of yours attains me not,
Nor any flame assails me of this burning.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-94">A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves
At this impediment, to which I send thee,
So that stern judgment there above is broken.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-97">In her entreaty she besought Lucia,
And said, "Thy faithful one now stands in need
Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him."
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-100">Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,
Hastened away, and came unto the place
Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-103">"Beatrice" said she, "the true praise of God,
Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,
For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-106">Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?
Dost thou not see the death that combats him
Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-109">Never were persons in the world so swift
To work their weal and to escape their woe,
As I, after such words as these were uttered,
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-112">Came hither downward from my blessed seat,
Confiding in thy dignified discourse,
Which honours thee, and those who've listened to it.'
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-115">After she thus had spoken unto me,
Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;
Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-118">And unto thee I came, as she desired;
I have delivered thee from that wild beast,
Which barred the beautiful mountain's short ascent.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-121">What is it, then?  Why, why dost thou delay?
Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?
Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-124">Seeing that three such Ladies benedight
Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,
And so much good my speech doth promise thee?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-127">Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,
Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,
Uplift themselves all open on their stems;
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-130">Such I became with my exhausted strength,
And such good courage to my heart there coursed,
That I began, like an intrepid person:
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-133">"O she compassionate, who succoured me,
And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon
The words of truth which she addressed to thee!
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-136">Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed
To the adventure, with these words of thine,
That to my first intent I have returned.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-139">Now go, for one sole will is in us both,
Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou."
Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,
</p>

<p id="inferno-ii-142">I entered on the deep and savage way.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto III

<p id="inferno-iii-1">"Through me the way is to the city dolent;
Through me the way is to eternal dole;
Through me the way among the people lost.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-4">Justice incited my sublime Creator;
Created me divine Omnipotence,
The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-7">Before me there were no created things,
Only eterne, and I eternal last.
All hope abandon, ye who enter in!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-10">These words in sombre colour I beheld
Written upon the summit of a gate;
Whence I: "Their sense is, Master, hard to me!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-13">And he to me, as one experienced:
"Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,
All cowardice must needs be here extinct.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-16">We to the place have come, where I have told thee
Thou shalt behold the people dolorous
Who have foregone the good of intellect."
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-19">And after he had laid his hand on mine
With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,
He led me in among the secret things.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-22">There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud
Resounded through the air without a star,
Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-25">Languages diverse, horrible dialects,
Accents of anger, words of agony,
And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-28">Made up a tumult that goes whirling on
For ever in that air for ever black,
Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-31">And I, who had my head with horror bound,
Said: "Master, what is this which now I hear?
What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-34">And he to me: "This miserable mode
Maintain the melancholy souls of those
Who lived withouten infamy or praise.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-37">Commingled are they with that caitiff choir
Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,
Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-40">The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;
Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,
For glory none the damned would have from them."
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-43">And I: "O Master, what so grievous is
To these, that maketh them lament so sore?"
He answered: "I will tell thee very briefly.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-46">These have no longer any hope of death;
And this blind life of theirs is so debased,
They envious are of every other fate.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-49">No fame of them the world permits to be;
Misericord and Justice both disdain them.
Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass."
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-52">And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,
Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,
That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-55">And after it there came so long a train
Of people, that I ne'er would have believed
That ever Death so many had undone.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-58">When some among them I had recognised,
I looked, and I beheld the shade of him
Who made through cowardice the great refusal.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-61">Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,
That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches
Hateful to God and to his enemies.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-64">These miscreants, who never were alive,
Were naked, and were stung exceedingly
By gadflies and by hornets that were there.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-67">These did their faces irrigate with blood,
Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet
By the disgusting worms was gathered up.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-70">And when to gazing farther I betook me.
People I saw on a great river's bank;
Whence said I: "Master, now vouchsafe to me,
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-73">That I may know who these are, and what law
Makes them appear so ready to pass over,
As I discern athwart the dusky light."
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-76">And he to me: "These things shall all be known
To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay
Upon the dismal shore of Acheron."
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-79">Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,
Fearing my words might irksome be to him,
From speech refrained I till we reached the river.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-82">And lo! towards us coming in a boat
An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,
Crying: "Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-85">Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;
I come to lead you to the other shore,
To the eternal shades in heat and frost.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-88">And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,
Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!"
But when he saw that I did not withdraw,
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-91">He said: "By other ways, by other ports
Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;
A lighter vessel needs must carry thee."
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-94">And unto him the Guide: "Vex thee not, Charon;
It is so willed there where is power to do
That which is willed; and farther question not."
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-97">Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks
Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,
Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-100">But all those souls who weary were and naked
Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,
As soon as they had heard those cruel words.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-103">God they blasphemed and their progenitors,
The human race, the place, the time, the seed
Of their engendering and of their birth!
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-106">Thereafter all together they drew back,
Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,
Which waiteth every man who fears not God.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-109">Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,
Beckoning to them, collects them all together,
Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-112">As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,
First one and then another, till the branch
Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-115">In similar wise the evil seed of Adam
Throw themselves from that margin one by one,
At signals, as a bird unto its lure.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-118">So they depart across the dusky wave,
And ere upon the other side they land,
Again on this side a new troop assembles.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-121">"My son," the courteous Master said to me,
"All those who perish in the wrath of God
Here meet together out of every land;
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-124">And ready are they to pass o'er the river,
Because celestial Justice spurs them on,
So that their fear is turned into desire.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-127">This way there never passes a good soul;
And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,
Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports."
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-130">This being finished, all the dusk champaign
Trembled so violently, that of that terror
The recollection bathes me still with sweat.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-133">The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,
And fulminated a vermilion light,
Which overmastered in me every sense,
</p>

<p id="inferno-iii-136">And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto IV

<p id="inferno-iv-1">Broke the deep lethargy within my head
A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,
Like to a person who by force is wakened;
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-4">And round about I moved my rested eyes,
Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,
To recognise the place wherein I was.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-7">True is it, that upon the verge I found me
Of the abysmal valley dolorous,
That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-10">Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,
So that by fixing on its depths my sight
Nothing whatever I discerned therein.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-13">"Let us descend now into the blind world,"
Began the Poet, pallid utterly;
"I will be first, and thou shalt second be."
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-16">And I, who of his colour was aware,
Said: "How shall I come, if thou art afraid,
Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-19">And he to me: "The anguish of the people
Who are below here in my face depicts
That pity which for terror thou hast taken.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-22">Let us go on, for the long way impels us."
Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter
The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-25">There, as it seemed to me from listening,
Were lamentations none, but only sighs,
That tremble made the everlasting air.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-28">And this arose from sorrow without torment,
Which the crowds had, that many were and great,
Of infants and of women and of men.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-31">To me the Master good: "Thou dost not ask
What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?
Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-34">That they sinned not; and if they merit had,
'Tis not enough, because they had not baptism
Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-37">And if they were before Christianity,
In the right manner they adored not God;
And among such as these am I myself.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-40">For such defects, and not for other guilt,
Lost are we and are only so far punished,
That without hope we live on in desire."
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-43">Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,
Because some people of much worthiness
I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-46">"Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,"
Began I, with desire of being certain
Of that Faith which o'ercometh every error,
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-49">"Came any one by his own merit hence,
Or by another's, who was blessed thereafter?"
And he, who understood my covert speech,
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-52">Replied: "I was a novice in this state,
When I saw hither come a Mighty One,
With sign of victory incoronate.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-55">Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,
And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,
Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-58">Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,
Israel with his father and his children,
And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-61">And others many, and he made them blessed;
And thou must know, that earlier than these
Never were any human spirits saved."
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-64">We ceased not to advance because he spake,
But still were passing onward through the forest,
The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-67">Not very far as yet our way had gone
This side the summit, when I saw a fire
That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-70">We were a little distant from it still,
But not so far that I in part discerned not
That honourable people held that place.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-73">"O thou who honourest every art and science,
Who may these be, which such great honour have,
That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-76">And he to me: "The honourable name,
That sounds of them above there in thy life,
Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them."
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-79">In the mean time a voice was heard by me:
"All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;
His shade returns again, that was departed."
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-82">After the voice had ceased and quiet was,
Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;
Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-85">To say to me began my gracious Master:
"Him with that falchion in his hand behold,
Who comes before the three, even as their lord.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-88">That one is Homer, Poet sovereign;
He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;
The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-91">Because to each of these with me applies
The name that solitary voice proclaimed,
They do me honour, and in that do well."
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-94">Thus I beheld assemble the fair school
Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,
Who o'er the others like an eagle soars.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-97">When they together had discoursed somewhat,
They turned to me with signs of salutation,
And on beholding this, my Master smiled;
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-100">And more of honour still, much more, they did me,
In that they made me one of their own band;
So that the sixth was I, 'mid so much wit.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-103">Thus we went on as far as to the light,
Things saying 'tis becoming to keep silent,
As was the saying of them where I was.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-106">We came unto a noble castle's foot,
Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,
Defended round by a fair rivulet;
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-109">This we passed over even as firm ground;
Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;
We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-112">People were there with solemn eyes and slow,
Of great authority in their countenance;
They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-115">Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side
Into an opening luminous and lofty,
So that they all of them were visible.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-118">There opposite, upon the green enamel,
Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,
Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-121">I saw Electra with companions many,
'Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,
Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-124">I saw Camilla and Penthesilea
On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,
Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-127">I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,
Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,
And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-130">When I had lifted up my brows a little,
The Master I beheld of those who know,
Sit with his philosophic family.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-133">All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.
There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,
Who nearer him before the others stand;
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-136">Democritus, who puts the world on chance,
Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,
Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-139">Of qualities I saw the good collector,
Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,
Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-142">Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,
Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,
Averroes, who the great Comment made.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-145">I cannot all of them pourtray in full,
Because so drives me onward the long theme,
That many times the word comes short of fact.
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-148">The sixfold company in two divides;
Another way my sapient Guide conducts me
Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;
</p>

<p id="inferno-iv-151">And to a place I come where nothing shines.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto V

<p id="inferno-v-1">Thus I descended out of the first circle
Down to the second, that less space begirds,
And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-4">There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;
Examines the transgressions at the entrance;
Judges, and sends according as he girds him.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-7">I say, that when the spirit evil-born
Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;
And this discriminator of transgressions
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-10">Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;
Girds himself with his tail as many times
As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-13">Always before him many of them stand;
They go by turns each one unto the judgment;
They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-16">"O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry
Comest," said Minos to me, when he saw me,
Leaving the practice of so great an office,
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-19">"Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;
Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee."
And unto him my Guide: "Why criest thou too?
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-22">Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;
It is so willed there where is power to do
That which is willed; and ask no further question."
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-25">And now begin the dolesome notes to grow
Audible unto me; now am I come
There where much lamentation strikes upon me.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-28">I came into a place mute of all light,
Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,
If by opposing winds 't is combated.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-31">The infernal hurricane that never rests
Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;
Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-34">When they arrive before the precipice,
There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,
There they blaspheme the puissance divine.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-37">I understood that unto such a torment
The carnal malefactors were condemned,
Who reason subjugate to appetite.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-40">And as the wings of starlings bear them on
In the cold season in large band and full,
So doth that blast the spirits maledict;
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-43">It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;
No hope doth comfort them for evermore,
Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-46">And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,
Making in air a long line of themselves,
So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-49">Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.
Whereupon said I: "Master, who are those
People, whom the black air so castigates?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-52">"The first of those, of whom intelligence
Thou fain wouldst have," then said he unto me,
"The empress was of many languages.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-55">To sensual vices she was so abandoned,
That lustful she made licit in her law,
To remove the blame to which she had been led.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-58">She is Semiramis, of whom we read
That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;
She held the land which now the Sultan rules.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-61">The next is she who killed herself for love,
And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;
Then Cleopatra the voluptuous."
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-64">Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless
Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,
Who at the last hour combated with Love.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-67">Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand
Shades did he name and point out with his finger,
Whom Love had separated from our life.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-70">After that I had listened to my Teacher,
Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,
Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-73">And I began: "O Poet, willingly
Speak would I to those two, who go together,
And seem upon the wind to be so light."
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-76">And, he to me: "Thou'lt mark, when they shall be
Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them
By love which leadeth them, and they will come."
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-79">Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,
My voice uplift I: "O ye weary souls!
Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it."
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-82">As turtle-doves, called onward by desire,
With open and steady wings to the sweet nest
Fly through the air by their volition borne,
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-85">So came they from the band where Dido is,
Approaching us athwart the air malign,
So strong was the affectionate appeal.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-88">"O living creature gracious and benignant,
Who visiting goest through the purple air
Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-91">If were the King of the Universe our friend,
We would pray unto him to give thee peace,
Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-94">Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,
That will we hear, and we will speak to you,
While silent is the wind, as it is now.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-97">Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,
Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends
To rest in peace with all his retinue.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-100">Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,
Seized this man for the person beautiful
That was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-103">Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,
Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,
That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-106">Love has conducted us unto one death;
Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!"
These words were borne along from them to us.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-109">As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,
I bowed my face, and so long held it down
Until the Poet said to me: "What thinkest?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-112">When I made answer, I began: "Alas!
How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,
Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-115">Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,
And I began: "Thine agonies, Francesca,
Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-118">But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,
By what and in what manner Love conceded,
That you should know your dubious desires?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-121">And she to me: "There is no greater sorrow
Than to be mindful of the happy time
In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-124">But, if to recognise the earliest root
Of love in us thou hast so great desire,
I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-127">One day we reading were for our delight
Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.
Alone we were and without any fear.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-130">Full many a time our eyes together drew
That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;
But one point only was it that o'ercame us.
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-133">When as we read of the much-longed-for smile
Being by such a noble lover kissed,
This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided,
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-136">Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.
Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.
That day no farther did we read therein."
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-139">And all the while one spirit uttered this,
The other one did weep so, that, for pity,
I swooned away as if I had been dying,
</p>

<p id="inferno-v-142">And fell, even as a dead body falls.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto VI

<p id="inferno-vi-1">At the return of consciousness, that closed
Before the pity of those two relations,
Which utterly with sadness had confused me,
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-4">New torments I behold, and new tormented
Around me, whichsoever way I move,
And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-7">In the third circle am I of the rain
Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;
Its law and quality are never new.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-10">Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,
Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;
Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-13">Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,
With his three gullets like a dog is barking
Over the people that are there submerged.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-16">Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,
And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;
He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-19">Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;
One side they make a shelter for the other;
Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-22">When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!
His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;
Not a limb had he that was motionless.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-25">And my Conductor, with his spans extended,
Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,
He threw it into those rapacious gullets.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-28">Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,
And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,
For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-31">The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed
Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders
Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-34">We passed across the shadows, which subdues
The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet
Upon their vanity that person seems.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-37">They all were lying prone upon the earth,
Excepting one, who sat upright as soon
As he beheld us passing on before him.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-40">"O thou that art conducted through this Hell,"
He said to me, "recall me, if thou canst;
Thyself wast made before I was unmade."
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-43">And I to him: "The anguish which thou hast
Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,
So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-46">But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful
A place art put, and in such punishment,
If some are greater, none is so displeasing."
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-49">And he to me: "Thy city, which is full
Of envy so that now the sack runs over,
Held me within it in the life serene.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-52">You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;
For the pernicious sin of gluttony
I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-55">And I, sad soul, am not the only one,
For all these suffer the like penalty
For the like sin;" and word no more spake he.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-58">I answered him: "Ciacco, thy wretchedness
Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;
But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-61">The citizens of the divided city;
If any there be just; and the occasion
Tell me why so much discord has assailed it."
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-64">And he to me: "They, after long contention,
Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party
Will drive the other out with much offence.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-67">Then afterwards behoves it this one fall
Within three suns, and rise again the other
By force of him who now is on the coast.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-70">High will it hold its forehead a long while,
Keeping the other under heavy burdens,
Howe'er it weeps thereat and is indignant.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-73">The just are two, and are not understood there;
Envy and Arrogance and Avarice
Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled."
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-76">Here ended he his tearful utterance;
And I to him: "I wish thee still to teach me,
And make a gift to me of further speech.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-79">Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,
Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,
And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-82">Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;
For great desire constraineth me to learn
If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom."
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-85">And he: "They are among the blacker souls;
A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;
If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-88">But when thou art again in the sweet world,
I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;
No more I tell thee and no more I answer."
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-91">Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,
Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;
He fell therewith prone like the other blind.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-94">And the Guide said to me: "He wakes no more
This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;
When shall approach the hostile Potentate,
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-97">Each one shall find again his dismal tomb,
Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,
Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes."
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-100">So we passed onward o'er the filthy mixture
Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,
Touching a little on the future life.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-103">Wherefore I said: "Master, these torments here,
Will they increase after the mighty sentence,
Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-106">And he to me: "Return unto thy science,
Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,
The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-109">Albeit that this people maledict
To true perfection never can attain,
Hereafter more than now they look to be."
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-112">Round in a circle by that road we went,
Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;
We came unto the point where the descent is;
</p>

<p id="inferno-vi-115">There we found Plutus the great enemy.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto VII

<p id="inferno-vii-1">"Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!"
Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;
And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-4">Said, to encourage me: "Let not thy fear
Harm thee; for any power that he may have
Shall not prevent thy going down this crag."
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-7">Then he turned round unto that bloated lip,
And said: "Be silent, thou accursed wolf;
Consume within thyself with thine own rage.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-10">Not causeless is this journey to the abyss;
Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought
Vengeance upon the proud adultery."
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-13">Even as the sails inflated by the wind
Involved together fall when snaps the mast,
So fell the cruel monster to the earth.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-16">Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,
Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore
Which all the woe of the universe insacks.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-19">Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many
New toils and sufferings as I beheld?
And why doth our transgression waste us so?
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-22">As doth the billow there upon Charybdis,
That breaks itself on that which it encounters,
So here the folk must dance their roundelay.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-25">Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,
On one side and the other, with great howls,
Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-28">They clashed together, and then at that point
Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,
Crying, "Why keepest?" and, "Why squanderest thou?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-31">Thus they returned along the lurid circle
On either hand unto the opposite point,
Shouting their shameful metre evermore.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-34">Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about
Through his half-circle to another joust;
And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-37">Exclaimed: "My Master, now declare to me
What people these are, and if all were clerks,
These shaven crowns upon the left of us."
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-40">And he to me: "All of them were asquint
In intellect in the first life, so much
That there with measure they no spending made.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-43">Clearly enough their voices bark it forth,
Whene'er they reach the two points of the circle,
Where sunders them the opposite defect.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-46">Clerks those were who no hairy covering
Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,
In whom doth Avarice practise its excess."
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-49">And I: "My Master, among such as these
I ought forsooth to recognise some few,
Who were infected with these maladies."
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-52">And he to me: "Vain thought thou entertainest;
The undiscerning life which made them sordid
Now makes them unto all discernment dim.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-55">Forever shall they come to these two buttings;
These from the sepulchre shall rise again
With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-58">Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world
Have ta'en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;
Whate'er it be, no words adorn I for it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-61">Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce
Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,
For which the human race each other buffet;
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-64">For all the gold that is beneath the moon,
Or ever has been, of these weary souls
Could never make a single one repose."
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-67">"Master," I said to him, "now tell me also
What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,
That has the world's goods so within its clutches?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-70">And he to me: "O creatures imbecile,
What ignorance is this which doth beset you?
Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-73">He whose omniscience everything transcends
The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,
That every part to every part may shine,
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-76">Distributing the light in equal measure;
He in like manner to the mundane splendours
Ordained a general ministress and guide,
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-79">That she might change at times the empty treasures
From race to race, from one blood to another,
Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-82">Therefore one people triumphs, and another
Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,
Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-85">Your knowledge has no counterstand against her;
She makes provision, judges, and pursues
Her governance, as theirs the other gods.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-88">Her permutations have not any truce;
Necessity makes her precipitate,
So often cometh who his turn obtains.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-91">And this is she who is so crucified
Even by those who ought to give her praise,
Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-94">But she is blissful, and she hears it not;
Among the other primal creatures gladsome
She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-97">Let us descend now unto greater woe;
Already sinks each star that was ascending
When I set out, and loitering is forbidden."
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-100">We crossed the circle to the other bank,
Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself
Along a gully that runs out of it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-103">The water was more sombre far than perse;
And we, in company with the dusky waves,
Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-106">A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,
This tristful brooklet, when it has descended
Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-109">And I, who stood intent upon beholding,
Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,
All of them naked and with angry look.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-112">They smote each other not alone with hands,
But with the head and with the breast and feet,
Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-115">Said the good Master: "Son, thou now beholdest
The souls of those whom anger overcame;
And likewise I would have thee know for certain
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-118">Beneath the water people are who sigh
And make this water bubble at the surface,
As the eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turns.
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-121">Fixed in the mire they say, 'We sullen were
In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,
Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-124">Now we are sullen in this sable mire.'
This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,
For with unbroken words they cannot say it."
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-127">Thus we went circling round the filthy fen
A great arc 'twixt the dry bank and the swamp,
With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;
</p>

<p id="inferno-vii-130">Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto VIII

<p id="inferno-viii-1">I say, continuing, that long before
We to the foot of that high tower had come,
Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-4">By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,
And from afar another answer them,
So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-7">And, to the sea of all discernment turned,
I said: "What sayeth this, and what respondeth
That other fire? and who are they that made it?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-10">And he to me: "Across the turbid waves
What is expected thou canst now discern,
If reek of the morass conceal it not."
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-13">Cord never shot an arrow from itself
That sped away athwart the air so swift,
As I beheld a very little boat
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-16">Come o'er the water tow'rds us at that moment,
Under the guidance of a single pilot,
Who shouted, "Now art thou arrived, fell soul?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-19">"Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain
For this once," said my Lord; "thou shalt not have us
Longer than in the passing of the slough."
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-22">As he who listens to some great deceit
That has been done to him, and then resents it,
Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-25">My Guide descended down into the boat,
And then he made me enter after him,
And only when I entered seemed it laden.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-28">Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,
The antique prow goes on its way, dividing
More of the water than 'tis wont with others.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-31">While we were running through the dead canal,
Uprose in front of me one full of mire,
And said, "Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-34">And I to him: "Although I come, I stay not;
But who art thou that hast become so squalid?"
"Thou seest that I am one who weeps," he answered.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-37">And I to him: "With weeping and with wailing,
Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;
For thee I know, though thou art all defiled."
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-40">Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;
Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,
Saying, "Away there with the other dogs!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-43">Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;
He kissed my face, and said: "Disdainful soul,
Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-46">That was an arrogant person in the world;
Goodness is none, that decks his memory;
So likewise here his shade is furious.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-49">How many are esteemed great kings up there,
Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,
Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-52">And I: "My Master, much should I be pleased,
If I could see him soused into this broth,
Before we issue forth out of the lake."
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-55">And he to me: "Ere unto thee the shore
Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;
Such a desire 'tis meet thou shouldst enjoy."
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-58">A little after that, I saw such havoc
Made of him by the people of the mire,
That still I praise and thank my God for it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-61">They all were shouting, "At Philippo Argenti!"
And that exasperate spirit Florentine
Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-64">We left him there, and more of him I tell not;
But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,
Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-67">And the good Master said: "Even now, my Son,
The city draweth near whose name is Dis,
With the grave citizens, with the great throng."
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-70">And I: "Its mosques already, Master, clearly
Within there in the valley I discern
Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-73">They were."  And he to me: "The fire eternal
That kindles them within makes them look red,
As thou beholdest in this nether Hell."
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-76">Then we arrived within the moats profound,
That circumvallate that disconsolate city;
The walls appeared to me to be of iron.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-79">Not without making first a circuit wide,
We came unto a place where loud the pilot
Cried out to us, "Debark, here is the entrance."
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-82">More than a thousand at the gates I saw
Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily
Were saying, "Who is this that without death
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-85">Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?"
And my sagacious Master made a sign
Of wishing secretly to speak with them.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-88">A little then they quelled their great disdain,
And said: "Come thou alone, and he begone
Who has so boldly entered these dominions.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-91">Let him return alone by his mad road;
Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,
Who hast escorted him through such dark regions."
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-94">Think, Reader, if I was discomforted
At utterance of the accursed words;
For never to return here I believed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-97">"O my dear Guide, who more than seven times
Hast rendered me security, and drawn me
From imminent peril that before me stood,
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-100">Do not desert me," said I, "thus undone;
And if the going farther be denied us,
Let us retrace our steps together swiftly."
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-103">And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,
Said unto me: "Fear not; because our passage
None can take from us, it by Such is given.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-106">But here await me, and thy weary spirit
Comfort and nourish with a better hope;
For in this nether world I will not leave thee."
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-109">So onward goes and there abandons me
My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,
For No and Yes within my head contend.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-112">I could not hear what he proposed to them;
But with them there he did not linger long,
Ere each within in rivalry ran back.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-115">They closed the portals, those our adversaries,
On my Lord's breast, who had remained without
And turned to me with footsteps far between.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-118">His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he
Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,
"Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-121">And unto me: "Thou, because I am angry,
Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,
Whatever for defence within be planned.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-124">This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;
For once they used it at less secret gate,
Which finds itself without a fastening still.
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-127">O'er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;
And now this side of it descends the steep,
Passing across the circles without escort,
</p>

<p id="inferno-viii-130">One by whose means the city shall be opened."
</p>

## Inferno - Canto IX

<p id="inferno-ix-1">That hue which cowardice brought out on me,
Beholding my Conductor backward turn,
Sooner repressed within him his new colour.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-4">He stopped attentive, like a man who listens,
Because the eye could not conduct him far
Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-7">"Still it behoveth us to win the fight,"
Began he; "Else. . .Such offered us herself. . .
O how I long that some one here arrive!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-10">Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning
He covered up with what came afterward,
That they were words quite different from the first;
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-13">But none the less his saying gave me fear,
Because I carried out the broken phrase,
Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-16">"Into this bottom of the doleful conch
Doth any e'er descend from the first grade,
Which for its pain has only hope cut off?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-19">This question put I; and he answered me:
"Seldom it comes to pass that one of us
Maketh the journey upon which I go.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-22">True is it, once before I here below
Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho,
Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-25">Naked of me short while the flesh had been,
Before within that wall she made me enter,
To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-28">That is the lowest region and the darkest,
And farthest from the heaven which circles all.
Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-31">This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,
Encompasses about the city dolent,
Where now we cannot enter without anger."
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-34">And more he said, but not in mind I have it;
Because mine eye had altogether drawn me
Tow'rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-37">Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen
The three infernal Furies stained with blood,
Who had the limbs of women and their mien,
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-40">And with the greenest hydras were begirt;
Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,
Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-43">And he who well the handmaids of the Queen
Of everlasting lamentation knew,
Said unto me: "Behold the fierce Erinnys.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-46">This is Megaera, on the left-hand side;
She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;
Tisiphone is between;" and then was silent.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-49">Each one her breast was rending with her nails;
They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,
That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-52">"Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!"
All shouted looking down; "in evil hour
Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-55">"Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,
For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,
No more returning upward would there be."
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-58">Thus said the Master; and he turned me round
Himself, and trusted not unto my hands
So far as not to blind me with his own.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-61">O ye who have undistempered intellects,
Observe the doctrine that conceals itself
Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-64">And now there came across the turbid waves
The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,
Because of which both of the margins trembled;
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-67">Not otherwise it was than of a wind
Impetuous on account of adverse heats,
That smites the forest, and, without restraint,
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-70">The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;
Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,
And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-73">Mine eyes he loosed, and said: "Direct the nerve
Of vision now along that ancient foam,
There yonder where that smoke is most intense."
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-76">Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent
Across the water scatter all abroad,
Until each one is huddled in the earth.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-79">More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,
Thus fleeing from before one who on foot
Was passing o'er the Styx with soles unwet.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-82">From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,
Waving his left hand oft in front of him,
And only with that anguish seemed he weary.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-85">Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,
And to the Master turned; and he made sign
That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-88">Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!
He reached the gate, and with a little rod
He opened it, for there was no resistance.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-91">"O banished out of Heaven, people despised!"
Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;
"Whence is this arrogance within you couched?
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-94">Wherefore recalcitrate against that will,
From which the end can never be cut off,
And which has many times increased your pain?
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-97">What helpeth it to butt against the fates?
Your Cerberus, if you remember well,
For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled."
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-100">Then he returned along the miry road,
And spake no word to us, but had the look
Of one whom other care constrains and goads
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-103">Than that of him who in his presence is;
And we our feet directed tow'rds the city,
After those holy words all confident.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-106">Within we entered without any contest;
And I, who inclination had to see
What the condition such a fortress holds,
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-109">Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,
And see on every hand an ample plain,
Full of distress and torment terrible.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-112">Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,
Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,
That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-115">The sepulchres make all the place uneven;
So likewise did they there on every side,
Saving that there the manner was more bitter;
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-118">For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,
By which they so intensely heated were,
That iron more so asks not any art.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-121">All of their coverings uplifted were,
And from them issued forth such dire laments,
Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-124">And I: "My Master, what are all those people
Who, having sepulture within those tombs,
Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-127">And he to me: "Here are the Heresiarchs,
With their disciples of all sects, and much
More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-130">Here like together with its like is buried;
And more and less the monuments are heated."
And when he to the right had turned, we passed
</p>

<p id="inferno-ix-133">Between the torments and high parapets.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto X

<p id="inferno-x-1">Now onward goes, along a narrow path
Between the torments and the city wall,
My Master, and I follow at his back.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-4">"O power supreme, that through these impious circles
Turnest me," I began, "as pleases thee,
Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-7">The people who are lying in these tombs,
Might they be seen? already are uplifted
The covers all, and no one keepeth guard."
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-10">And he to me: "They all will be closed up
When from Jehoshaphat they shall return
Here with the bodies they have left above.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-13">Their cemetery have upon this side
With Epicurus all his followers,
Who with the body mortal make the soul;
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-16">But in the question thou dost put to me,
Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,
And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent."
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-19">And I: "Good Leader, I but keep concealed
From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,
Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me."
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-22">"O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire
Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,
Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-25">Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest
A native of that noble fatherland,
To which perhaps I too molestful was."
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-28">Upon a sudden issued forth this sound
From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,
Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-31">And unto me he said: "Turn thee; what dost thou?
Behold there Farinata who has risen;
From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him."
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-34">I had already fixed mine eyes on his,
And he uprose erect with breast and front
E'en as if Hell he had in great despite.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-37">And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader
Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,
Exclaiming, "Let thy words explicit be."
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-40">As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb
Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,
Then asked of me, "Who were thine ancestors?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-43">I, who desirous of obeying was,
Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;
Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-46">Then said he: "Fiercely adverse have they been
To me, and to my fathers, and my party;
So that two several times I scattered them."
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-49">"If they were banished, they returned on all sides,"
I answered him, "the first time and the second;
But yours have not acquired that art aright."
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-52">Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered
Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;
I think that he had risen on his knees.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-55">Round me he gazed, as if solicitude
He had to see if some one else were with me,
But after his suspicion was all spent,
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-58">Weeping, he said to me: "If through this blind
Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,
Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-61">And I to him: "I come not of myself;
He who is waiting yonder leads me here,
Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had."
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-64">His language and the mode of punishment
Already unto me had read his name;
On that account my answer was so full.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-67">Up starting suddenly, he cried out: "How
Saidst thou,--he had?  Is he not still alive?
Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-70">When he became aware of some delay,
Which I before my answer made, supine
He fell again, and forth appeared no more.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-73">But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire
I had remained, did not his aspect change,
Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-76">"And if," continuing his first discourse,
"They have that art," he said, "not learned aright,
That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-79">But fifty times shall not rekindled be
The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,
Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-82">And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,
Say why that people is so pitiless
Against my race in each one of its laws?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-85">Whence I to him: "The slaughter and great carnage
Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause
Such orisons in our temple to be made."
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-88">After his head he with a sigh had shaken,
"There I was not alone," he said, "nor surely
Without a cause had with the others moved.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-91">But there I was alone, where every one
Consented to the laying waste of Florence,
He who defended her with open face."
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-94">"Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,"
I him entreated, "solve for me that knot,
Which has entangled my conceptions here.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-97">It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,
Beforehand whatsoe'er time brings with it,
And in the present have another mode."
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-100">"We see, like those who have imperfect sight,
The things," he said, "that distant are from us;
So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-103">When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain
Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,
Not anything know we of your human state.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-106">Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead
Will be our knowledge from the moment when
The portal of the future shall be closed."
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-109">Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,
Said: "Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,
That still his son is with the living joined.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-112">And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,
Tell him I did it because I was thinking
Already of the error you have solved me."
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-115">And now my Master was recalling me,
Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit
That he would tell me who was with him there.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-118">He said: "With more than a thousand here I lie;
Within here is the second Frederick,
And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not."
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-121">Thereon he hid himself; and I towards
The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting
Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-124">He moved along; and afterward thus going,
He said to me, "Why art thou so bewildered?"
And I in his inquiry satisfied him.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-127">"Let memory preserve what thou hast heard
Against thyself," that Sage commanded me,
"And now attend here;" and he raised his finger.
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-130">"When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet
Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,
From her thou'lt know the journey of thy life."
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-133">Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;
We left the wall, and went towards the middle,
Along a path that strikes into a valley,
</p>

<p id="inferno-x-136">Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XI

<p id="inferno-xi-1">Upon the margin of a lofty bank
Which great rocks broken in a circle made,
We came upon a still more cruel throng;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-4">And there, by reason of the horrible
Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,
We drew ourselves aside behind the cover
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-7">Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,
Which said: "Pope Anastasius I hold,
Whom out of the right way Photinus drew."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-10">"Slow it behoveth our descent to be,
So that the sense be first a little used
To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-13">The Master thus; and unto him I said,
"Some compensation find, that the time pass not
Idly;" and he: "Thou seest I think of that.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-16">My son, upon the inside of these rocks,"
Began he then to say, "are three small circles,
From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-19">They all are full of spirits maledict;
But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,
Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-22">Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven,
Injury is the end; and all such end
Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-25">But because fraud is man's peculiar vice,
More it displeases God; and so stand lowest
The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-28">All the first circle of the Violent is;
But since force may be used against three persons,
In three rounds 'tis divided and constructed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-31">To God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we
Use force; I say on them and on their things,
As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-34">A death by violence, and painful wounds,
Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance
Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-37">Whence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,
Marauders, and freebooters, the first round
Tormenteth all in companies diverse.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-40">Man may lay violent hands upon himself
And his own goods; and therefore in the second
Round must perforce without avail repent
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-43">Whoever of your world deprives himself,
Who games, and dissipates his property,
And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-46">Violence can be done the Deity,
In heart denying and blaspheming Him,
And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-49">And for this reason doth the smallest round
Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,
And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-52">Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,
A man may practise upon him who trusts,
And him who doth no confidence imburse.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-55">This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers
Only the bond of love which Nature makes;
Wherefore within the second circle nestle
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-58">Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,
Falsification, theft, and simony,
Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-61">By the other mode, forgotten is that love
Which Nature makes, and what is after added,
From which there is a special faith engendered.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-64">Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is
Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,
Whoe'er betrays for ever is consumed."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-67">And I: "My Master, clear enough proceeds
Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes
This cavern and the people who possess it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-70">But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,
Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,
And who encounter with such bitter tongues,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-73">Wherefore are they inside of the red city
Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,
And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-76">And unto me he said: "Why wanders so
Thine intellect from that which it is wont?
Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-79">Hast thou no recollection of those words
With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses
The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,--
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-82">Incontinence, and Malice, and insane
Bestiality? and how Incontinence
Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-85">If thou regardest this conclusion well,
And to thy mind recallest who they are
That up outside are undergoing penance,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-88">Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons
They separated are, and why less wroth
Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-91">"O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,
Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest,
That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-94">Once more a little backward turn thee," said I,
"There where thou sayest that usury offends
Goodness divine, and disengage the knot."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-97">"Philosophy," he said, "to him who heeds it,
Noteth, not only in one place alone,
After what manner Nature takes her course
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-100">From Intellect Divine, and from its art;
And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,
After not many pages shalt thou find,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-103">That this your art as far as possible
Follows, as the disciple doth the master;
So that your art is, as it were, God's grandchild.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-106">From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind
Genesis at the beginning, it behoves
Mankind to gain their life and to advance;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-109">And since the usurer takes another way,
Nature herself and in her follower
Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-112">But follow, now, as I would fain go on,
For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon,
And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xi-115">And far beyond there we descend the crag."
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XII

<p id="inferno-xii-1">The place where to descend the bank we came
Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,
Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-4">Such as that ruin is which in the flank
Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,
Either by earthquake or by failing stay,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-7">For from the mountain's top, from which it moved,
Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,
Some path 'twould give to him who was above;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-10">Even such was the descent of that ravine,
And on the border of the broken chasm
The infamy of Crete was stretched along,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-13">Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;
And when he us beheld, he bit himself,
Even as one whom anger racks within.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-16">My Sage towards him shouted: "Peradventure
Thou think'st that here may be the Duke of Athens,
Who in the world above brought death to thee?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-19">Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not
Instructed by thy sister, but he comes
In order to behold your punishments."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-22">As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment
In which he has received the mortal blow,
Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-25">The Minotaur beheld I do the like;
And he, the wary, cried: "Run to the passage;
While he wroth, 'tis well thou shouldst descend."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-28">Thus down we took our way o'er that discharge
Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves
Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-31">Thoughtful I went; and he said: "Thou art thinking
Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded
By that brute anger which just now I quenched.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-34">Now will I have thee know, the other time
I here descended to the nether Hell,
This precipice had not yet fallen down.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-37">But truly, if I well discern, a little
Before His coming who the mighty spoil
Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-40">Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley
Trembled so, that I thought the Universe
Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-43">The world ofttimes converted into chaos;
And at that moment this primeval crag
Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-46">But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near
The river of blood, within which boiling is
Whoe'er by violence doth injure others."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-49">O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,
That spurs us onward so in our short life,
And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-52">I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,
As one which all the plain encompasses,
Conformable to what my Guide had said.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-55">And between this and the embankment's foot
Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,
As in the world they used the chase to follow.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-58">Beholding us descend, each one stood still,
And from the squadron three detached themselves,
With bows and arrows in advance selected;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-61">And from afar one cried: "Unto what torment
Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?
Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-64">My Master said: "Our answer will we make
To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,
That will of thine was evermore so hasty."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-67">Then touched he me, and said: "This one is Nessus,
Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,
And for himself, himself did vengeance take.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-70">And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,
Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;
That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-73">Thousands and thousands go about the moat
Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges
Out of the blood, more than his crime allots."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-76">Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;
Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch
Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-79">After he had uncovered his great mouth,
He said to his companions: "Are you ware
That he behind moveth whate'er he touches?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-82">Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men."
And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,
Where the two natures are together joined,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-85">Replied: "Indeed he lives, and thus alone
Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;
Necessity, and not delight, impels us.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-88">Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja,
Who unto me committed this new office;
No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-91">But by that virtue through which I am moving
My steps along this savage thoroughfare,
Give us some one of thine, to be with us,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-94">And who may show us where to pass the ford,
And who may carry this one on his back;
For 'tis no spirit that can walk the air."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-97">Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,
And said to Nessus: "Turn and do thou guide them,
And warn aside, if other band may meet you."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-100">We with our faithful escort onward moved
Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,
Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-103">People I saw within up to the eyebrows,
And the great Centaur said: "Tyrants are these,
Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-106">Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here
Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius
Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-109">That forehead there which has the hair so black
Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,
Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-112">Up in the world was by his stepson slain."
Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,
"Now he be first to thee, and second I."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-115">A little farther on the Centaur stopped
Above a folk, who far down as the throat
Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-118">A shade he showed us on one side alone,
Saying: "He cleft asunder in God's bosom
The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-121">Then people saw I, who from out the river
Lifted their heads and also all the chest;
And many among these I recognised.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-124">Thus ever more and more grew shallower
That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;
And there across the moat our passage was.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-127">"Even as thou here upon this side beholdest
The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,"
The Centaur said, "I wish thee to believe
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-130">That on this other more and more declines
Its bed, until it reunites itself
Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-133">Justice divine, upon this side, is goading
That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,
And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-136">The tears which with the boiling it unseals
In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,
Who made upon the highways so much war."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xii-139">Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XIII

<p id="inferno-xiii-1">Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,
When we had put ourselves within a wood,
That was not marked by any path whatever.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-4">Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,
Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,
Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-7">Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,
Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold
'Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-10">There do the hideous Harpies make their nests,
Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,
With sad announcement of impending doom;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-13">Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human,
And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;
They make laments upon the wondrous trees.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-16">And the good Master: "Ere thou enter farther,
Know that thou art within the second round,"
Thus he began to say, "and shalt be, till
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-19">Thou comest out upon the horrible sand;
Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see
Things that will credence give unto my speech."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-22">I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,
And person none beheld I who might make them,
Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-25">I think he thought that I perhaps might think
So many voices issued through those trunks
From people who concealed themselves from us;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-28">Therefore the Master said: "If thou break off
Some little spray from any of these trees,
The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-31">Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,
And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;
And the trunk cried, "Why dost thou mangle me?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-34">After it had become embrowned with blood,
It recommenced its cry: "Why dost thou rend me?
Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-37">Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;
Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,
Even if the souls of serpents we had been."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-40">As out of a green brand, that is on fire
At one of the ends, and from the other drips
And hisses with the wind that is escaping;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-43">So from that splinter issued forth together
Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip
Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-46">"Had he been able sooner to believe,"
My Sage made answer, "O thou wounded soul,
What only in my verses he has seen,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-49">Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;
Whereas the thing incredible has caused me
To put him to an act which grieveth me.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-52">But tell him who thou wast, so that by way
Of some amends thy fame he may refresh
Up in the world, to which he can return."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-55">And the trunk said: "So thy sweet words allure me,
I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,
That I a little to discourse am tempted.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-58">I am the one who both keys had in keeping
Of Frederick's heart, and turned them to and fro
So softly in unlocking and in locking,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-61">That from his secrets most men I withheld;
Fidelity I bore the glorious office
So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-64">The courtesan who never from the dwelling
Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,
Death universal and the vice of courts,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-67">Inflamed against me all the other minds,
And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,
That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-70">My spirit, in disdainful exultation,
Thinking by dying to escape disdain,
Made me unjust against myself, the just.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-73">I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,
Do swear to you that never broke I faith
Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-76">And to the world if one of you return,
Let him my memory comfort, which is lying
Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-79">Waited awhile, and then: "Since he is silent,"
The Poet said to me, "lose not the time,
But speak, and question him, if more may please thee."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-82">Whence I to him: "Do thou again inquire
Concerning what thou thinks't will satisfy me;
For I cannot, such pity is in my heart."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-85">Therefore he recommenced: "So may the man
Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,
Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-88">To tell us in what way the soul is bound
Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,
If any from such members e'er is freed."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-91">Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward
The wind was into such a voice converted:
"With brevity shall be replied to you.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-94">When the exasperated soul abandons
The body whence it rent itself away,
Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-97">It falls into the forest, and no part
Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,
There like a grain of spelt it germinates.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-100">It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;
The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,
Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-103">Like others for our spoils shall we return;
But not that any one may them revest,
For 'tis not just to have what one casts off.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-106">Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal
Forest our bodies shall suspended be,
Each to the thorn of his molested shade."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-109">We were attentive still unto the trunk,
Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,
When by a tumult we were overtaken,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-112">In the same way as he is who perceives
The boar and chase approaching to his stand,
Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-115">And two behold! upon our left-hand side,
Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,
That of the forest, every fan they broke.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-118">He who was in advance: "Now help, Death, help!"
And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,
Was shouting: "Lano, were not so alert
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-121">Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!"
And then, perchance because his breath was failing,
He grouped himself together with a bush.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-124">Behind them was the forest full of black
She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot
As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-127">On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,
And him they lacerated piece by piece,
Thereafter bore away those aching members.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-130">Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,
And led me to the bush, that all in vain
Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-133">"O Jacopo," it said, "of Sant' Andrea,
What helped it thee of me to make a screen?
What blame have I in thy nefarious life?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-136">When near him had the Master stayed his steps,
He said: "Who wast thou, that through wounds so many
Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-139">And he to us: "O souls, that hither come
To look upon the shameful massacre
That has so rent away from me my leaves,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-142">Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;
I of that city was which to the Baptist
Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-145">Forever with his art will make it sad.
And were it not that on the pass of Arno
Some glimpses of him are remaining still,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-148">Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it
Upon the ashes left by Attila,
In vain had caused their labour to be done.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiii-151">Of my own house I made myself a gibbet."
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XIV

<p id="inferno-xiv-1">Because the charity of my native place
Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,
And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-4">Then came we to the confine, where disparted
The second round is from the third, and where
A horrible form of Justice is beheld.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-7">Clearly to manifest these novel things,
I say that we arrived upon a plain,
Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-10">The dolorous forest is a garland to it
All round about, as the sad moat to that;
There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-13">The soil was of an arid and thick sand,
Not of another fashion made than that
Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-16">Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou
By each one to be dreaded, who doth read
That which was manifest unto mine eyes!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-19">Of naked souls beheld I many herds,
Who all were weeping very miserably,
And over them seemed set a law diverse.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-22">Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;
And some were sitting all drawn up together,
And others went about continually.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-25">Those who were going round were far the more,
And those were less who lay down to their torment,
But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-28">O'er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,
Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,
As of the snow on Alp without a wind.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-31">As Alexander, in those torrid parts
Of India, beheld upon his host
Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-34">Whence he provided with his phalanxes
To trample down the soil, because the vapour
Better extinguished was while it was single;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-37">Thus was descending the eternal heat,
Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder
Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-40">Without repose forever was the dance
Of miserable hands, now there, now here,
Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-43">"Master," began I, "thou who overcomest
All things except the demons dire, that issued
Against us at the entrance of the gate,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-46">Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not
The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,
So that the rain seems not to ripen him?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-49">And he himself, who had become aware
That I was questioning my Guide about him,
Cried: "Such as I was living, am I, dead.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-52">If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom
He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,
Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-55">And if he wearied out by turns the others
In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,
Vociferating, 'Help, good Vulcan, help!'
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-58">Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,
And shot his bolts at me with all his might,
He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-61">Then did my Leader speak with such great force,
That I had never heard him speak so loud:
"O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-64">Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;
Not any torment, saving thine own rage,
Would be unto thy fury pain complete."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-67">Then he turned round to me with better lip,
Saying: "One of the Seven Kings was he
Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-70">God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;
But, as I said to him, his own despites
Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-73">Now follow me, and mind thou do not place
As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,
But always keep them close unto the wood."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-76">Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes
Forth from the wood a little rivulet,
Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-79">As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,
The sinful women later share among them,
So downward through the sand it went its way.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-82">The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,
Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;
Whence I perceived that there the passage was.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-85">"In all the rest which I have shown to thee
Since we have entered in within the gate
Whose threshold unto no one is denied,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-88">Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes
So notable as is the present river,
Which all the little flames above it quenches."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-91">These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him
That he would give me largess of the food,
For which he had given me largess of desire.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-94">"In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,"
Said he thereafterward, "whose name is Crete,
Under whose king the world of old was chaste.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-97">There is a mountain there, that once was glad
With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;
Now 'tis deserted, as a thing worn out.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-100">Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle
Of her own son; and to conceal him better,
Whene'er he cried, she there had clamours made.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-103">A grand old man stands in the mount erect,
Who holds his shoulders turned tow'rds Damietta,
And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-106">His head is fashioned of refined gold,
And of pure silver are the arms and breast;
Then he is brass as far down as the fork.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-109">From that point downward all is chosen iron,
Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,
And more he stands on that than on the other.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-112">Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure
Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,
Which gathered together perforate that cavern.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-115">From rock to rock they fall into this valley;
Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;
Then downward go along this narrow sluice
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-118">Unto that point where is no more descending.
They form Cocytus; what that pool may be
Thou shalt behold, so here 'tis not narrated."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-121">And I to him: "If so the present runnel
Doth take its rise in this way from our world,
Why only on this verge appears it to us?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-124">And he to me: "Thou knowest the place is round,
And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,
Still to the left descending to the bottom,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-127">Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.
Therefore if something new appear to us,
It should not bring amazement to thy face."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-130">And I again: "Master, where shall be found
Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou'rt silent,
And sayest the other of this rain is made?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-133">"In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,"
Replied he; "but the boiling of the red
Water might well solve one of them thou makest.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-136">Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,
There where the souls repair to lave themselves,
When sin repented of has been removed."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-139">Then said he: "It is time now to abandon
The wood; take heed that thou come after me;
A way the margins make that are not burning,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xiv-142">And over them all vapours are extinguished."
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XV

<p id="inferno-xv-1">Now bears us onward one of the hard margins,
And so the brooklet's mist o'ershadows it,
From fire it saves the water and the dikes.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-4">Even as the Flemings, 'twixt Cadsand and Bruges,
Fearing the flood that tow'rds them hurls itself,
Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-7">And as the Paduans along the Brenta,
To guard their villas and their villages,
Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-10">In such similitude had those been made,
Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,
Whoever he might be, the master made them.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-13">Now were we from the forest so remote,
I could not have discovered where it was,
Even if backward I had turned myself,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-16">When we a company of souls encountered,
Who came beside the dike, and every one
Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-19">To eye each other under a new moon,
And so towards us sharpened they their brows
As an old tailor at the needle's eye.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-22">Thus scrutinised by such a family,
By some one I was recognised, who seized
My garment's hem, and cried out, "What a marvel!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-25">And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,
On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,
That the scorched countenance prevented not
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-28">His recognition by my intellect;
And bowing down my face unto his own,
I made reply, "Are you here, Ser Brunetto?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-31">And he: "May't not displease thee, O my son,
If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini
Backward return and let the trail go on."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-34">I said to him: "With all my power I ask it;
And if you wish me to sit down with you,
I will, if he please, for I go with him."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-37">"O son," he said, "whoever of this herd
A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,
Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-40">Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,
And afterward will I rejoin my band,
Which goes lamenting its eternal doom."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-43">I did not dare to go down from the road
Level to walk with him; but my head bowed
I held as one who goeth reverently.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-46">And he began: "What fortune or what fate
Before the last day leadeth thee down here?
And who is this that showeth thee the way?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-49">"Up there above us in the life serene,"
I answered him, "I lost me in a valley,
Or ever yet my age had been completed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-52">But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;
This one appeared to me, returning thither,
And homeward leadeth me along this road."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-55">And he to me: "If thou thy star do follow,
Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,
If well I judged in the life beautiful.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-58">And if I had not died so prematurely,
Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,
I would have given thee comfort in the work.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-61">But that ungrateful and malignant people,
Which of old time from Fesole descended,
And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-64">Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;
And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs
It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-67">Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind;
A people avaricious, envious, proud;
Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-70">Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,
One party and the other shall be hungry
For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-73">Their litter let the beasts of Fesole
Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,
If any still upon their dunghill rise,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-76">In which may yet revive the consecrated
Seed of those Romans, who remained there when
The nest of such great malice it became."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-79">"If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,"
Replied I to him, "not yet would you be
In banishment from human nature placed;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-82">For in my mind is fixed, and touches now
My heart the dear and good paternal image
Of you, when in the world from hour to hour
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-85">You taught me how a man becomes eternal;
And how much I am grateful, while I live
Behoves that in my language be discerned.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-88">What you narrate of my career I write,
And keep it to be glossed with other text
By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-91">This much will I have manifest to you;
Provided that my conscience do not chide me,
For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-94">Such handsel is not new unto mine ears;
Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around
As it may please her, and the churl his mattock."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-97">My Master thereupon on his right cheek
Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;
Then said: "He listeneth well who noteth it."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-100">Nor speaking less on that account, I go
With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are
His most known and most eminent companions.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-103">And he to me: "To know of some is well;
Of others it were laudable to be silent,
For short would be the time for so much speech.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-106">Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks,
And men of letters great and of great fame,
In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-109">Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,
And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there
If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-112">That one, who by the Servant of the Servants
From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,
Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-115">More would I say, but coming and discoursing
Can be no longer; for that I behold
New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-118">A people comes with whom I may not be;
Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,
In which I still live, and no more I ask."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-121">Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those
Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle
Across the plain; and seemed to be among them
</p>

<p id="inferno-xv-124">The one who wins, and not the one who loses.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XVI

<p id="inferno-xvi-1">Now was I where was heard the reverberation
Of water falling into the next round,
Like to that humming which the beehives make,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-4">When shadows three together started forth,
Running, from out a company that passed
Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-7">Towards us came they, and each one cried out:
"Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest
To be some one of our depraved city."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-10">Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,
Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!
It pains me still but to remember it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-13">Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;
He turned his face towards me, and "Now wait,"
He said; "to these we should be courteous.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-16">And if it were not for the fire that darts
The nature of this region, I should say
That haste were more becoming thee than them."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-19">As soon as we stood still, they recommenced
The old refrain, and when they overtook us,
Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-22">As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,
Watching for their advantage and their hold,
Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-25">Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage
Direct to me, so that in opposite wise
His neck and feet continual journey made.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-28">And, "If the misery of this soft place
Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,"
Began one, "and our aspect black and blistered,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-31">Let the renown of us thy mind incline
To tell us who thou art, who thus securely
Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-34">He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,
Naked and skinless though he now may go,
Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-37">He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;
His name was Guidoguerra, and in life
Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-40">The other, who close by me treads the sand,
Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame
Above there in the world should welcome be.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-43">And I, who with them on the cross am placed,
Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly
My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-46">Could I have been protected from the fire,
Below I should have thrown myself among them,
And think the Teacher would have suffered it;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-49">But as I should have burned and baked myself,
My terror overmastered my good will,
Which made me greedy of embracing them.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-52">Then I began: "Sorrow and not disdain
Did your condition fix within me so,
That tardily it wholly is stripped off,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-55">As soon as this my Lord said unto me
Words, on account of which I thought within me
That people such as you are were approaching.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-58">I of your city am; and evermore
Your labours and your honourable names
I with affection have retraced and heard.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-61">I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits
Promised to me by the veracious Leader;
But to the centre first I needs must plunge."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-64">"So may the soul for a long while conduct
Those limbs of thine," did he make answer then,
"And so may thy renown shine after thee,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-67">Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell
Within our city, as they used to do,
Or if they wholly have gone out of it;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-70">For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment
With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,
Doth greatly mortify us with his words."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-73">"The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,
Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,
Florence, so that thou weep'st thereat already!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-76">In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;
And the three, taking that for my reply,
Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-79">"If other times so little it doth cost thee,"
Replied they all, "to satisfy another,
Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-82">Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,
And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,
When it shall pleasure thee to say, 'I was,'
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-85">See that thou speak of us unto the people."
Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight
It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-88">Not an Amen could possibly be said
So rapidly as they had disappeared;
Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-91">I followed him, and little had we gone,
Before the sound of water was so near us,
That speaking we should hardly have been heard.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-94">Even as that stream which holdeth its own course
The first from Monte Veso tow'rds the East,
Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-97">Which is above called Acquacheta, ere
It down descendeth into its low bed,
And at Forli is vacant of that name,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-100">Reverberates there above San Benedetto
From Alps, by falling at a single leap,
Where for a thousand there were room enough;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-103">Thus downward from a bank precipitate,
We found resounding that dark-tinted water,
So that it soon the ear would have offended.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-106">I had a cord around about me girt,
And therewithal I whilom had designed
To take the panther with the painted skin.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-109">After I this had all from me unloosed,
As my Conductor had commanded me,
I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-112">Whereat he turned himself to the right side,
And at a little distance from the verge,
He cast it down into that deep abyss.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-115">"It must needs be some novelty respond,"
I said within myself, "to the new signal
The Master with his eye is following so."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-118">Ah me! how very cautious men should be
With those who not alone behold the act,
But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-121">He said to me: "Soon there will upward come
What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming
Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-124">Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,
A man should close his lips as far as may be,
Because without his fault it causes shame;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-127">But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes
Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,
So may they not be void of lasting favour,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-130">Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere
I saw a figure swimming upward come,
Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-133">Even as he returns who goeth down
Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled
Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvi-136">Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XVII

<p id="inferno-xvii-1">"Behold the monster with the pointed tail,
Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,
Behold him who infecteth all the world."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-4">Thus unto me my Guide began to say,
And beckoned him that he should come to shore,
Near to the confine of the trodden marble;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-7">And that uncleanly image of deceit
Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,
But on the border did not drag its tail.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-10">The face was as the face of a just man,
Its semblance outwardly was so benign,
And of a serpent all the trunk beside.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-13">Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;
The back, and breast, and both the sides it had
Depicted o'er with nooses and with shields.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-16">With colours more, groundwork or broidery
Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,
Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-19">As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,
That part are in the water, part on land;
And as among the guzzling Germans there,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-22">The beaver plants himself to wage his war;
So that vile monster lay upon the border,
Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-25">His tail was wholly quivering in the void,
Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,
That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-28">The Guide said: "Now perforce must turn aside
Our way a little, even to that beast
Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-31">We therefore on the right side descended,
And made ten steps upon the outer verge,
Completely to avoid the sand and flame;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-34">And after we are come to him, I see
A little farther off upon the sand
A people sitting near the hollow place.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-37">Then said to me the Master: "So that full
Experience of this round thou bear away,
Now go and see what their condition is.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-40">There let thy conversation be concise;
Till thou returnest I will speak with him,
That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-43">Thus farther still upon the outermost
Head of that seventh circle all alone
I went, where sat the melancholy folk.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-46">Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;
This way, that way, they helped them with their hands
Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-49">Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,
Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when
By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-52">When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces
Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,
Not one of them I knew; but I perceived
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-55">That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,
Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;
And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-58">And as I gazing round me come among them,
Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw
That had the face and posture of a lion.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-61">Proceeding then the current of my sight,
Another of them saw I, red as blood,
Display a goose more white than butter is.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-64">And one, who with an azure sow and gravid
Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,
Said unto me: "What dost thou in this moat?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-67">Now get thee gone; and since thou'rt still alive,
Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,
Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-70">A Paduan am I with these Florentines;
Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,
Exclaiming, 'Come the sovereign cavalier,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-73">He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;'"
Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust
His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-76">And fearing lest my longer stay might vex
Him who had warned me not to tarry long,
Backward I turned me from those weary souls.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-79">I found my Guide, who had already mounted
Upon the back of that wild animal,
And said to me: "Now be both strong and bold.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-82">Now we descend by stairways such as these;
Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,
So that the tail may have no power to harm thee."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-85">Such as he is who has so near the ague
Of quartan that his nails are blue already,
And trembles all, but looking at the shade;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-88">Even such became I at those proffered words;
But shame in me his menaces produced,
Which maketh servant strong before good master.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-91">I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;
I wished to say, and yet the voice came not
As I believed, "Take heed that thou embrace me."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-94">But he, who other times had rescued me
In other peril, soon as I had mounted,
Within his arms encircled and sustained me,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-97">And said: "Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;
The circles large, and the descent be little;
Think of the novel burden which thou hast."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-100">Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,
Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;
And when he wholly felt himself afloat,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-103">There where his breast had been he turned his tail,
And that extended like an eel he moved,
And with his paws drew to himself the air.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-106">A greater fear I do not think there was
What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,
Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-109">Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks
Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,
His father crying, "An ill way thou takest!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-112">Than was my own, when I perceived myself
On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished
The sight of everything but of the monster.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-115">Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;
Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only
By wind upon my face and from below.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-118">I heard already on the right the whirlpool
Making a horrible crashing under us;
Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-121">Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;
Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,
Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-124">I saw then, for before I had not seen it,
The turning and descending, by great horrors
That were approaching upon divers sides.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-127">As falcon who has long been on the wing,
Who, without seeing either lure or bird,
Maketh the falconer say, "Ah me, thou stoopest,"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-130">Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,
Thorough a hundred circles, and alights
Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-133">Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,
Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,
And being disencumbered of our persons,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xvii-136">He sped away as arrow from the string.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XVIII

<p id="inferno-xviii-1">There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,
Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,
As is the circle that around it turns.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-4">Right in the middle of the field malign
There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,
Of which its place the structure will recount.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-7">Round, then, is that enclosure which remains
Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,
And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-10">As where for the protection of the walls
Many and many moats surround the castles,
The part in which they are a figure forms,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-13">Just such an image those presented there;
And as about such strongholds from their gates
Unto the outer bank are little bridges,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-16">So from the precipice's base did crags
Project, which intersected dikes and moats,
Unto the well that truncates and collects them.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-19">Within this place, down shaken from the back
Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet
Held to the left, and I moved on behind.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-22">Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,
New torments, and new wielders of the lash,
Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-25">Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;
This side the middle came they facing us,
Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-28">Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,
The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,
Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-31">For all upon one side towards the Castle
Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter's;
On the other side they go towards the Mountain.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-34">This side and that, along the livid stone
Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,
Who cruelly were beating them behind.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-37">Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs
At the first blows! and sooth not any one
The second waited for, nor for the third.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-40">While I was going on, mine eyes by one
Encountered were; and straight I said: "Already
With sight of this one I am not unfed."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-43">Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,
And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,
And to my going somewhat back assented;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-46">And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,
Lowering his face, but little it availed him;
For said I: "Thou that castest down thine eyes,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-49">If false are not the features which thou bearest,
Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;
But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-52">And he to me: "Unwillingly I tell it;
But forces me thine utterance distinct,
Which makes me recollect the ancient world.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-55">I was the one who the fair Ghisola
Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,
Howe'er the shameless story may be told.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-58">Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;
Nay, rather is this place so full of them,
That not so many tongues to-day are taught
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-61">'Twixt Reno and Savena to say 'sipa;'
And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,
Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-64">While speaking in this manner, with his scourge
A demon smote him, and said: "Get thee gone
Pander, there are no women here for coin."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-67">I joined myself again unto mine Escort;
Thereafterward with footsteps few we came
To where a crag projected from the bank.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-70">This very easily did we ascend,
And turning to the right along its ridge,
From those eternal circles we departed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-73">When we were there, where it is hollowed out
Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,
The Guide said: "Wait, and see that on thee strike
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-76">The vision of those others evil-born,
Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,
Because together with us they have gone."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-79">From the old bridge we looked upon the train
Which tow'rds us came upon the other border,
And which the scourges in like manner smite.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-82">And the good Master, without my inquiring,
Said to me: "See that tall one who is coming,
And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-85">Still what a royal aspect he retains!
That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning
The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-88">He by the isle of Lemnos passed along
After the daring women pitiless
Had unto death devoted all their males.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-91">There with his tokens and with ornate words
Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden
Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-94">There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;
Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,
And also for Medea is vengeance done.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-97">With him go those who in such wise deceive;
And this sufficient be of the first valley
To know, and those that in its jaws it holds."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-100">We were already where the narrow path
Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms
Of that a buttress for another arch.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-103">Thence we heard people, who are making moan
In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,
And with their palms beating upon themselves
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-106">The margins were incrusted with a mould
By exhalation from below, that sticks there,
And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-109">The bottom is so deep, no place suffices
To give us sight of it, without ascending
The arch's back, where most the crag impends.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-112">Thither we came, and thence down in the moat
I saw a people smothered in a filth
That out of human privies seemed to flow;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-115">And whilst below there with mine eye I search,
I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,
It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-118">He screamed to me: "Wherefore art thou so eager
To look at me more than the other foul ones?"
And I to him: "Because, if I remember,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-121">I have already seen thee with dry hair,
And thou'rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;
Therefore I eye thee more than all the others."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-124">And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:
"The flatteries have submerged me here below,
Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-127">Then said to me the Guide: "See that thou thrust
Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,
That with thine eyes thou well the face attain
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-130">Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,
Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,
And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-133">Thais the harlot is it, who replied
Unto her paramour, when he said, 'Have I
Great gratitude from thee?'--'Nay, marvellous;'
</p>

<p id="inferno-xviii-136">And herewith let our sight be satisfied."
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XIX

<p id="inferno-xix-1">O Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples,
Ye who the things of God, which ought to be
The brides of holiness, rapaciously
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-4">For silver and for gold do prostitute,
Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound,
Because in this third Bolgia ye abide.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-7">We had already on the following tomb
Ascended to that portion of the crag
Which o'er the middle of the moat hangs plumb.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-10">Wisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest
In heaven, in earth, and in the evil world,
And with what justice doth thy power distribute!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-13">I saw upon the sides and on the bottom
The livid stone with perforations filled,
All of one size, and every one was round.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-16">To me less ample seemed they not, nor greater
Than those that in my beautiful Saint John
Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-19">And one of which, not many years ago,
I broke for some one, who was drowning in it;
Be this a seal all men to undeceive.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-22">Out of the mouth of each one there protruded
The feet of a transgressor, and the legs
Up to the calf, the rest within remained.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-25">In all of them the soles were both on fire;
Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,
They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-28">Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont
To move upon the outer surface only,
So likewise was it there from heel to point.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-31">"Master, who is that one who writhes himself,
More than his other comrades quivering,"
I said, "and whom a redder flame is sucking?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-34">And he to me: "If thou wilt have me bear thee
Down there along that bank which lowest lies,
From him thou'lt know his errors and himself."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-37">And I: "What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;
Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not
From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-40">Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;
We turned, and on the left-hand side descended
Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-43">And the good Master yet from off his haunch
Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me
Of him who so lamented with his shanks.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-46">"Whoe'er thou art, that standest upside down,
O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,"
To say began I, "if thou canst, speak out."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-49">I stood even as the friar who is confessing
The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,
Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-52">And he cried out: "Dost thou stand there already,
Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?
By many years the record lied to me.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-55">Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,
For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud
The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-58">Such I became, as people are who stand,
Not comprehending what is answered them,
As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-61">Then said Virgilius: "Say to him straightway,
'I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.'"
And I replied as was imposed on me.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-64">Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,
Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation
Said to me: "Then what wantest thou of me?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-67">If who I am thou carest so much to know,
That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,
Know that I vested was with the great mantle;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-70">And truly was I son of the She-bear,
So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth
Above, and here myself, I pocketed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-73">Beneath my head the others are dragged down
Who have preceded me in simony,
Flattened along the fissure of the rock.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-76">Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever
That one shall come who I believed thou wast,
What time the sudden question I proposed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-79">But longer I my feet already toast,
And here have been in this way upside down,
Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-82">For after him shall come of fouler deed
From tow'rds the west a Pastor without law,
Such as befits to cover him and me.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-85">New Jason will he be, of whom we read
In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,
So he who governs France shall be to this one."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-88">I do not know if I were here too bold,
That him I answered only in this metre:
"I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-91">Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,
Before he put the keys into his keeping?
Truly he nothing asked but 'Follow me.'
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-94">Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias
Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen
Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-97">Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,
And keep safe guard o'er the ill-gotten money,
Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-100">And were it not that still forbids it me
The reverence for the keys superlative
Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-103">I would make use of words more grievous still;
Because your avarice afflicts the world,
Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-106">The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,
When she who sitteth upon many waters
To fornicate with kings by him was seen;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-109">The same who with the seven heads was born,
And power and strength from the ten horns received,
So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-112">Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;
And from the idolater how differ ye,
Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-115">Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,
Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower
Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-118">And while I sang to him such notes as these,
Either that anger or that conscience stung him,
He struggled violently with both his feet.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-121">I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,
With such contented lip he listened ever
Unto the sound of the true words expressed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-124">Therefore with both his arms he took me up,
And when he had me all upon his breast,
Remounted by the way where he descended.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-127">Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;
But bore me to the summit of the arch
Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-130">There tenderly he laid his burden down,
Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,
That would have been hard passage for the goats:
</p>

<p id="inferno-xix-133">Thence was unveiled to me another valley.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XX

<p id="inferno-xx-1">Of a new pain behoves me to make verses
And give material to the twentieth canto
Of the first song, which is of the submerged.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-4">I was already thoroughly disposed
To peer down into the uncovered depth,
Which bathed itself with tears of agony;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-7">And people saw I through the circular valley,
Silent and weeping, coming at the pace
Which in this world the Litanies assume.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-10">As lower down my sight descended on them,
Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted
From chin to the beginning of the chest;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-13">For tow'rds the reins the countenance was turned,
And backward it behoved them to advance,
As to look forward had been taken from them.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-16">Perchance indeed by violence of palsy
Some one has been thus wholly turned awry;
But I ne'er saw it, nor believe it can be.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-19">As God may let thee, Reader, gather fruit
From this thy reading, think now for thyself
How I could ever keep my face unmoistened,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-22">When our own image near me I beheld
Distorted so, the weeping of the eyes
Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-25">Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak
Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said
To me: "Art thou, too, of the other fools?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-28">Here pity lives when it is wholly dead;
Who is a greater reprobate than he
Who feels compassion at the doom divine?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-31">Lift up, lift up thy head, and see for whom
Opened the earth before the Thebans' eyes;
Wherefore they all cried: 'Whither rushest thou,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-34">Amphiaraus?  Why dost leave the war?'
And downward ceased he not to fall amain
As far as Minos, who lays hold on all.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-37">See, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!
Because he wished to see too far before him
Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-40">Behold Tiresias, who his semblance changed,
When from a male a female he became,
His members being all of them transformed;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-43">And afterwards was forced to strike once more
The two entangled serpents with his rod,
Ere he could have again his manly plumes.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-46">That Aruns is, who backs the other's belly,
Who in the hills of Luni, there where grubs
The Carrarese who houses underneath,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-49">Among the marbles white a cavern had
For his abode; whence to behold the stars
And sea, the view was not cut off from him.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-52">And she there, who is covering up her breasts,
Which thou beholdest not, with loosened tresses,
And on that side has all the hairy skin,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-55">Was Manto, who made quest through many lands,
Afterwards tarried there where I was born;
Whereof I would thou list to me a little.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-58">After her father had from life departed,
And the city of Bacchus had become enslaved,
She a long season wandered through the world.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-61">Above in beauteous Italy lies a lake
At the Alp's foot that shuts in Germany
Over Tyrol, and has the name Benaco.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-64">By a thousand springs, I think, and more, is bathed,
'Twixt Garda and Val Camonica, Pennino,
With water that grows stagnant in that lake.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-67">Midway a place is where the Trentine Pastor,
And he of Brescia, and the Veronese
Might give his blessing, if he passed that way.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-70">Sitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong,
To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks,
Where round about the bank descendeth lowest.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-73">There of necessity must fall whatever
In bosom of Benaco cannot stay,
And grows a river down through verdant pastures.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-76">Soon as the water doth begin to run,
No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio,
Far as Governo, where it falls in Po.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-79">Not far it runs before it finds a plain
In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy,
And oft 'tis wont in summer to be sickly.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-82">Passing that way the virgin pitiless
Land in the middle of the fen descried,
Untilled and naked of inhabitants;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-85">There to escape all human intercourse,
She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise
And lived, and left her empty body there.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-88">The men, thereafter, who were scattered round,
Collected in that place, which was made strong
By the lagoon it had on every side;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-91">They built their city over those dead bones,
And, after her who first the place selected,
Mantua named it, without other omen.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-94">Its people once within more crowded were,
Ere the stupidity of Casalodi
From Pinamonte had received deceit.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-97">Therefore I caution thee, if e'er thou hearest
Originate my city otherwise,
No falsehood may the verity defraud."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-100">And I: "My Master, thy discourses are
To me so certain, and so take my faith,
That unto me the rest would be spent coals.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-103">But tell me of the people who are passing,
If any one note-worthy thou beholdest,
For only unto that my mind reverts."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-106">Then said he to me: "He who from the cheek
Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders
Was, at the time when Greece was void of males,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-109">So that there scarce remained one in the cradle,
An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment,
In Aulis, when to sever the first cable.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-112">Eryphylus his name was, and so sings
My lofty Tragedy in some part or other;
That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-115">The next, who is so slender in the flanks,
Was Michael Scott, who of a verity
Of magical illusions knew the game.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-118">Behold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,
Who now unto his leather and his thread
Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-121">Behold the wretched ones, who left the needle,
The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers;
They wrought their magic spells with herb and image.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-124">But come now, for already holds the confines
Of both the hemispheres, and under Seville
Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-127">And yesternight the moon was round already;
Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee
From time to time within the forest deep."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xx-130">Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XXI

<p id="inferno-xxi-1">From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things
Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,
We came along, and held the summit, when
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-4">We halted to behold another fissure
Of Malebolge and other vain laments;
And I beheld it marvellously dark.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-7">As in the Arsenal of the Venetians
Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch
To smear their unsound vessels o'er again,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-10">For sail they cannot; and instead thereof
One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks
The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-13">One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,
This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,
Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-16">Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,
Was boiling down below there a dense pitch
Which upon every side the bank belimed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-19">I saw it, but I did not see within it
Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,
And all swell up and resubside compressed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-22">The while below there fixedly I gazed,
My Leader, crying out: "Beware, beware!"
Drew me unto himself from where I stood.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-25">Then I turned round, as one who is impatient
To see what it behoves him to escape,
And whom a sudden terror doth unman,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-28">Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;
And I beheld behind us a black devil,
Running along upon the crag, approach.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-31">Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!
And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,
With open wings and light upon his feet!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-34">His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,
A sinner did encumber with both haunches,
And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-37">From off our bridge, he said: "O Malebranche,
Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;
Plunge him beneath, for I return for others
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-40">Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.
All there are barrators, except Bonturo;
No into Yes for money there is changed."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-43">He hurled him down, and over the hard crag
Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened
In so much hurry to pursue a thief.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-46">The other sank, and rose again face downward;
But the demons, under cover of the bridge,
Cried: "Here the Santo Volto has no place!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-49">Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;
Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,
Do not uplift thyself above the pitch."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-52">They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;
They said: "It here behoves thee to dance covered,
That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-55">Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make
Immerse into the middle of the caldron
The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-58">Said the good Master to me: "That it be not
Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down
Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-61">And for no outrage that is done to me
Be thou afraid, because these things I know,
For once before was I in such a scuffle."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-64">Then he passed on beyond the bridge's head,
And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,
Need was for him to have a steadfast front.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-67">With the same fury, and the same uproar,
As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,
Who on a sudden begs, where'er he stops,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-70">They issued from beneath the little bridge,
And turned against him all their grappling-irons;
But he cried out: "Be none of you malignant!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-73">Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me,
Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,
And then take counsel as to grappling me."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-76">They all cried out: "Let Malacoda go;"
Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,
And he came to him, saying: "What avails it?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-79">"Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me
Advanced into this place," my Master said,
"Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-82">Without the will divine, and fate auspicious?
Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed
That I another show this savage road."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-85">Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,
That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,
And to the others said: "Now strike him not."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-88">And unto me my Guide: "O thou, who sittest
Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,
Securely now return to me again."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-91">Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;
And all the devils forward thrust themselves,
So that I feared they would not keep their compact.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-94">And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers
Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,
Seeing themselves among so many foes.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-97">Close did I press myself with all my person
Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes
From off their countenance, which was not good.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-100">They lowered their rakes, and "Wilt thou have me hit him,"
They said to one another, "on the rump?"
And answered: "Yes; see that thou nick him with it."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-103">But the same demon who was holding parley
With my Conductor turned him very quickly,
And said: "Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-106">Then said to us: "You can no farther go
Forward upon this crag, because is lying
All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-109">And if it still doth please you to go onward,
Pursue your way along upon this rock;
Near is another crag that yields a path.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-112">Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,
One thousand and two hundred sixty-six
Years were complete, that here the way was broken.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-115">I send in that direction some of mine
To see if any one doth air himself;
Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-118">Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,"
Began he to cry out, "and thou, Cagnazzo;
And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-121">Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,
And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,
And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-124">Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;
Let these be safe as far as the next crag,
That all unbroken passes o'er the dens."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-127">"O me! what is it, Master, that I see?
Pray let us go," I said, "without an escort,
If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-130">If thou art as observant as thy wont is,
Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,
And with their brows are threatening woe to us?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-133">And he to me: "I will not have thee fear;
Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,
Because they do it for those boiling wretches."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-136">Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;
But first had each one thrust his tongue between
His teeth towards their leader for a signal;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxi-139">And he had made a trumpet of his rump.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XXII

<p id="inferno-xxii-1">I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,
Begin the storming, and their muster make,
And sometimes starting off for their escape;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-4">Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,
O Aretines, and foragers go forth,
Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-7">Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,
With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,
And with our own, and with outlandish things,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-10">But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth
Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,
Nor ship by any sign of land or star.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-13">We went upon our way with the ten demons;
Ah, savage company! but in the church
With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-16">Ever upon the pitch was my intent,
To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,
And of the people who therein were burned.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-19">Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign
To mariners by arching of the back,
That they should counsel take to save their vessel,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-22">Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,
One of the sinners would display his back,
And in less time conceal it than it lightens.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-25">As on the brink of water in a ditch
The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,
So that they hide their feet and other bulk,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-28">So upon every side the sinners stood;
But ever as Barbariccia near them came,
Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-31">I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,
One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass
One frog remains, and down another dives;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-34">And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,
Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,
And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-37">I knew, before, the names of all of them,
So had I noted them when they were chosen,
And when they called each other, listened how.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-40">"O Rubicante, see that thou do lay
Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,"
Cried all together the accursed ones.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-43">And I: "My Master, see to it, if thou canst,
That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,
Thus come into his adversaries' hands."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-46">Near to the side of him my Leader drew,
Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:
"I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-49">My mother placed me servant to a lord,
For she had borne me to a ribald knave,
Destroyer of himself and of his things.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-52">Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;
I set me there to practise barratry,
For which I pay the reckoning in this heat."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-55">And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,
On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,
Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-58">Among malicious cats the mouse had come;
But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,
And said: "Stand ye aside, while I enfork him."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-61">And to my Master he turned round his head;
"Ask him again," he said, "if more thou wish
To know from him, before some one destroy him."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-64">The Guide: "Now tell then of the other culprits;
Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,
Under the pitch?"  And he: "I separated
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-67">Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;
Would that I still were covered up with him,
For I should fear not either claw nor hook!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-70">And Libicocco: "We have borne too much;"
And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,
So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-73">Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him
Down at the legs; whence their Decurion
Turned round and round about with evil look.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-76">When they again somewhat were pacified,
Of him, who still was looking at his wound,
Demanded my Conductor without stay:
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-79">"Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting
Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?"
And he replied: "It was the Friar Gomita,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-82">He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,
Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,
And dealt so with them each exults thereat;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-85">Money he took, and let them smoothly off,
As he says; and in other offices
A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-88">Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche
Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia
To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-91">O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;
Still farther would I speak, but am afraid
Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-94">And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,
Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,
Said: "Stand aside there, thou malicious bird."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-97">"If you desire either to see or hear,"
The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,
"Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-100">But let the Malebranche cease a little,
So that these may not their revenges fear,
And I, down sitting in this very place,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-103">For one that I am will make seven come,
When I shall whistle, as our custom is
To do whenever one of us comes out."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-106">Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,
Shaking his head, and said: "Just hear the trick
Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-109">Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,
Responded: "I by far too cunning am,
When I procure for mine a greater sadness."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-112">Alichin held not in, but running counter
Unto the rest, said to him: "If thou dive,
I will not follow thee upon the gallop,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-115">But I will beat my wings above the pitch;
The height be left, and be the bank a shield
To see if thou alone dost countervail us."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-118">O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!
Each to the other side his eyes averted;
He first, who most reluctant was to do it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-121">The Navarrese selected well his time;
Planted his feet on land, and in a moment
Leaped, and released himself from their design.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-124">Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,
But he most who was cause of the defeat;
Therefore he moved, and cried: "Thou art o'ertakern."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-127">But little it availed, for wings could not
Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,
And, flying, upward he his breast directed;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-130">Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden
Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,
And upward he returneth cross and weary.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-133">Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina
Flying behind him followed close, desirous
The other should escape, to have a quarrel.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-136">And when the barrator had disappeared,
He turned his talons upon his companion,
And grappled with him right above the moat.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-139">But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk
To clapperclaw him well; and both of them
Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-142">A sudden intercessor was the heat;
But ne'ertheless of rising there was naught,
To such degree they had their wings belimed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-145">Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia
Made four of them fly to the other side
With all their gaffs, and very speedily
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-148">This side and that they to their posts descended;
They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,
Who were already baked within the crust,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxii-151">And in this manner busied did we leave them.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XXIII

<p id="inferno-xxiii-1">Silent, alone, and without company
We went, the one in front, the other after,
As go the Minor Friars along their way.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-4">Upon the fable of Aesop was directed
My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,
Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-7">For 'mo' and 'issa' are not more alike
Than this one is to that, if well we couple
End and beginning with a steadfast mind.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-10">And even as one thought from another springs,
So afterward from that was born another,
Which the first fear within me double made.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-13">Thus did I ponder: "These on our account
Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff
So great, that much I think it must annoy them.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-16">If anger be engrafted on ill-will,
They will come after us more merciless
Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-19">I felt my hair stand all on end already
With terror, and stood backwardly intent,
When said I: "Master, if thou hidest not
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-22">Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche
I am in dread; we have them now behind us;
I so imagine them, I already feel them."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-25">And he: "If I were made of leaded glass,
Thine outward image I should not attract
Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-28">Just now thy thoughts came in among my own,
With similar attitude and similar face,
So that of both one counsel sole I made.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-31">If peradventure the right bank so slope
That we to the next Bolgia can descend,
We shall escape from the imagined chase."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-34">Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,
When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,
Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-37">My Leader on a sudden seized me up,
Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,
And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-40">Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,
Having more care of him than of herself,
So that she clothes her only with a shift;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-43">And downward from the top of the hard bank
Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,
That one side of the other Bolgia walls.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-46">Ne'er ran so swiftly water through a sluice
To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,
When nearest to the paddles it approaches,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-49">As did my Master down along that border,
Bearing me with him on his breast away,
As his own son, and not as a companion.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-52">Hardly the bed of the ravine below
His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill
Right over us; but he was not afraid;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-55">For the high Providence, which had ordained
To place them ministers of the fifth moat,
The power of thence departing took from all.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-58">A painted people there below we found,
Who went about with footsteps very slow,
Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-61">They had on mantles with the hoods low down
Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut
That in Cologne they for the monks are made.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-64">Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles;
But inwardly all leaden and so heavy
That Frederick used to put them on of straw.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-67">O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!
Again we turned us, still to the left hand
Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-70">But owing to the weight, that weary folk
Came on so tardily, that we were new
In company at each motion of the haunch.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-73">Whence I unto my Leader: "See thou find
Some one who may by deed or name be known,
And thus in going move thine eye about."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-76">And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,
Cried to us from behind: "Stay ye your feet,
Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-79">Perhaps thou'lt have from me what thou demandest."
Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: "Wait,
And then according to his pace proceed."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-82">I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste
Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;
But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-85">When they came up, long with an eye askance
They scanned me without uttering a word.
Then to each other turned, and said together:
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-88">"He by the action of his throat seems living;
And if they dead are, by what privilege
Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-91">Then said to me: "Tuscan, who to the college
Of miserable hypocrites art come,
Do not disdain to tell us who thou art."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-94">And I to them: "Born was I, and grew up
In the great town on the fair river of Arno,
And with the body am I've always had.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-97">But who are ye, in whom there trickles down
Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?
And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-100">And one replied to me: "These orange cloaks
Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights
Cause in this way their balances to creak.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-103">Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;
I Catalano, and he Loderingo
Named, and together taken by thy city,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-106">As the wont is to take one man alone,
For maintenance of its peace; and we were such
That still it is apparent round Gardingo."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-109">"O Friars," began I, "your iniquitous. . ."
But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed
One crucified with three stakes on the ground.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-112">When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,
Blowing into his beard with suspirations;
And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-115">Said to me: "This transfixed one, whom thou seest,
Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet
To put one man to torture for the people.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-118">Crosswise and naked is he on the path,
As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,
Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-121">And in like mode his father-in-law is punished
Within this moat, and the others of the council,
Which for the Jews was a malignant seed."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-124">And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel
O'er him who was extended on the cross
So vilely in eternal banishment.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-127">Then he directed to the Friar this voice:
"Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us
If to the right hand any pass slope down
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-130">By which we two may issue forth from here,
Without constraining some of the black angels
To come and extricate us from this deep."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-133">Then he made answer: "Nearer than thou hopest
There is a rock, that forth from the great circle
Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-136">Save that at this 'tis broken, and does not bridge it;
You will be able to mount up the ruin,
That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-139">The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;
Then said: "The business badly he recounted
Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-142">And the Friar: "Many of the Devil's vices
Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,
That he's a liar and the father of lies."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-145">Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,
Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;
Whence from the heavy-laden I departed
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiii-148">After the prints of his beloved feet.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XXIV

<p id="inferno-xxiv-1">In that part of the youthful year wherein
The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,
And now the nights draw near to half the day,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-4">What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground
The outward semblance of her sister white,
But little lasts the temper of her pen,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-7">The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,
Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign
All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-10">Returns in doors, and up and down laments,
Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;
Then he returns and hope revives again,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-13">Seeing the world has changed its countenance
In little time, and takes his shepherd's crook,
And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-16">Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,
When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,
And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-19">For as we came unto the ruined bridge,
The Leader turned to me with that sweet look
Which at the mountain's foot I first beheld.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-22">His arms he opened, after some advisement
Within himself elected, looking first
Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-25">And even as he who acts and meditates,
For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,
So upward lifting me towards the summit
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-28">Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,
Saying: "To that one grapple afterwards,
But try first if 'tis such that it will hold thee."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-31">This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;
For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,
Were able to ascend from jag to jag.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-34">And had it not been, that upon that precinct
Shorter was the ascent than on the other,
He I know not, but I had been dead beat.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-37">But because Malebolge tow'rds the mouth
Of the profoundest well is all inclining,
The structure of each valley doth import
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-40">That one bank rises and the other sinks.
Still we arrived at length upon the point
Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-43">The breath was from my lungs so milked away,
When I was up, that I could go no farther,
Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-46">"Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,"
My Master said; "for sitting upon down,
Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-49">Withouten which whoso his life consumes
Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,
As smoke in air or in the water foam.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-52">And therefore raise thee up, o'ercome the anguish
With spirit that o'ercometh every battle,
If with its heavy body it sink not.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-55">A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;
'Tis not enough from these to have departed;
Let it avail thee, if thou understand me."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-58">Then I uprose, showing myself provided
Better with breath than I did feel myself,
And said: "Go on, for I am strong and bold."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-61">Upward we took our way along the crag,
Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,
And more precipitous far than that before.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-64">Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;
Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,
Not well adapted to articulate words.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-67">I know not what it said, though o'er the back
I now was of the arch that passes there;
But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-70">I was bent downward, but my living eyes
Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;
Wherefore I: "Master, see that thou arrive
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-73">At the next round, and let us descend the wall;
For as from hence I hear and understand not,
So I look down and nothing I distinguish."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-76">"Other response," he said, "I make thee not,
Except the doing; for the modest asking
Ought to be followed by the deed in silence."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-79">We from the bridge descended at its head,
Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,
And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-82">And I beheld therein a terrible throng
Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,
That the remembrance still congeals my blood
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-85">Let Libya boast no longer with her sand;
For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae
She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-88">Neither so many plagues nor so malignant
E'er showed she with all Ethiopia,
Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-91">Among this cruel and most dismal throng
People were running naked and affrighted.
Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-94">They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;
These riveted upon their reins the tail
And head, and were in front of them entwined.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-97">And lo! at one who was upon our side
There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him
There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-100">Nor 'O' so quickly e'er, nor 'I' was written,
As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly
Behoved it that in falling he became.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-103">And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,
The ashes drew together, and of themselves
Into himself they instantly returned.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-106">Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed
The phoenix dies, and then is born again,
When it approaches its five-hundredth year;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-109">On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,
But only on tears of incense and amomum,
And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-112">And as he is who falls, and knows not how,
By force of demons who to earth down drag him,
Or other oppilation that binds man,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-115">When he arises and around him looks,
Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish
Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-118">Such was that sinner after he had risen.
Justice of God! O how severe it is,
That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-121">The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;
Whence he replied: "I rained from Tuscany
A short time since into this cruel gorge.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-124">A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,
Even as the mule I was; I'm Vanni Fucci,
Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-127">And I unto the Guide: "Tell him to stir not,
And ask what crime has thrust him here below,
For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-130">And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,
But unto me directed mind and face,
And with a melancholy shame was painted.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-133">Then said: "It pains me more that thou hast caught me
Amid this misery where thou seest me,
Than when I from the other life was taken.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-136">What thou demandest I cannot deny;
So low am I put down because I robbed
The sacristy of the fair ornaments,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-139">And falsely once 'twas laid upon another;
But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,
If thou shalt e'er be out of the dark places,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-142">Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:
Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;
Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-145">Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,
Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,
And with impetuous and bitter tempest
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-148">Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;
When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,
So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxiv-151">And this I've said that it may give thee pain."
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XXV

<p id="inferno-xxv-1">At the conclusion of his words, the thief
Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs,
Crying: "Take that, God, for at thee I aim them."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-4">From that time forth the serpents were my friends;
For one entwined itself about his neck
As if it said: "I will not thou speak more;"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-7">And round his arms another, and rebound him,
Clinching itself together so in front,
That with them he could not a motion make.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-10">Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not
To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,
Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-13">Through all the sombre circles of this Hell,
Spirit I saw not against God so proud,
Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-16">He fled away, and spake no further word;
And I beheld a Centaur full of rage
Come crying out: "Where is, where is the scoffer?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-19">I do not think Maremma has so many
Serpents as he had all along his back,
As far as where our countenance begins.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-22">Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape,
With wings wide open was a dragon lying,
And he sets fire to all that he encounters.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-25">My Master said: "That one is Cacus, who
Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine
Created oftentimes a lake of blood.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-28">He goes not on the same road with his brothers,
By reason of the fraudulent theft he made
Of the great herd, which he had near to him;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-31">Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath
The mace of Hercules, who peradventure
Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-34">While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,
And spirits three had underneath us come,
Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-37">Until what time they shouted: "Who are you?"
On which account our story made a halt,
And then we were intent on them alone.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-40">I did not know them; but it came to pass,
As it is wont to happen by some chance,
That one to name the other was compelled,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-43">Exclaiming: "Where can Cianfa have remained?"
Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,
Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-46">If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe
What I shall say, it will no marvel be,
For I who saw it hardly can admit it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-49">As I was holding raised on them my brows,
Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth
In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-52">With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,
And with the forward ones his arms it seized;
Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-55">The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,
And put its tail through in between the two,
And up behind along the reins outspread it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-58">Ivy was never fastened by its barbs
Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile
Upon the other's limbs entwined its own.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-61">Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax
They had been made, and intermixed their colour;
Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-64">E'en as proceedeth on before the flame
Upward along the paper a brown colour,
Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-67">The other two looked on, and each of them
Cried out: "O me, Agnello, how thou changest!
Behold, thou now art neither two nor one."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-70">Already the two heads had one become,
When there appeared to us two figures mingled
Into one face, wherein the two were lost.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-73">Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,
The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest
Members became that never yet were seen.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-76">Every original aspect there was cancelled;
Two and yet none did the perverted image
Appear, and such departed with slow pace.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-79">Even as a lizard, under the great scourge
Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,
Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-82">Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies
Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,
Livid and black as is a peppercorn.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-85">And in that part whereat is first received
Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;
Then downward fell in front of him extended.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-88">The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;
Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,
Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-91">He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;
One through the wound, the other through the mouth
Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-94">Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions
Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,
And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-97">Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;
For if him to a snake, her to fountain,
Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-100">Because two natures never front to front
Has he transmuted, so that both the forms
To interchange their matter ready were.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-103">Together they responded in such wise,
That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,
And eke the wounded drew his feet together.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-106">The legs together with the thighs themselves
Adhered so, that in little time the juncture
No sign whatever made that was apparent.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-109">He with the cloven tail assumed the figure
The other one was losing, and his skin
Became elastic, and the other's hard.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-112">I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,
And both feet of the reptile, that were short,
Lengthen as much as those contracted were.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-115">Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,
Became the member that a man conceals,
And of his own the wretch had two created.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-118">While both of them the exhalation veils
With a new colour, and engenders hair
On one of them and depilates the other,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-121">The one uprose and down the other fell,
Though turning not away their impious lamps,
Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-124">He who was standing drew it tow'rds the temples,
And from excess of matter, which came thither,
Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-127">What did not backward run and was retained
Of that excess made to the face a nose,
And the lips thickened far as was befitting.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-130">He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,
And backward draws the ears into his head,
In the same manner as the snail its horns;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-133">And so the tongue, which was entire and apt
For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked
In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-136">The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,
Along the valley hissing takes to flight,
And after him the other speaking sputters.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-139">Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,
And said to the other: "I'll have Buoso run,
Crawling as I have done, along this road."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-142">In this way I beheld the seventh ballast
Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse
The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-145">And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be
Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,
They could not flee away so secretly
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-148">But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;
And he it was who sole of three companions,
Which came in the beginning, was not changed;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxv-151">The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XXVI

<p id="inferno-xxvi-1">Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great,
That over sea and land thou beatest thy wings,
And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-4">Among the thieves five citizens of thine
Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me,
And thou thereby to no great honour risest.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-7">But if when morn is near our dreams are true,
Feel shalt thou in a little time from now
What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-10">And if it now were, it were not too soon;
Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,
For 'twill aggrieve me more the more I age.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-13">We went our way, and up along the stairs
The bourns had made us to descend before,
Remounted my Conductor and drew me.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-16">And following the solitary path
Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,
The foot without the hand sped not at all.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-19">Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,
When I direct my mind to what I saw,
And more my genius curb than I am wont,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-22">That it may run not unless virtue guide it;
So that if some good star, or better thing,
Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-25">As many as the hind (who on the hill
Rests at the time when he who lights the world
His countenance keeps least concealed from us,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-28">While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)
Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,
Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-31">With flames as manifold resplendent all
Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware
As soon as I was where the depth appeared.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-34">And such as he who with the bears avenged him
Beheld Elijah's chariot at departing,
What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-37">For with his eye he could not follow it
So as to see aught else than flame alone,
Even as a little cloud ascending upward,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-40">Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment
Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,
And every flame a sinner steals away.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-43">I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,
So that, if I had seized not on a rock,
Down had I fallen without being pushed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-46">And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,
Exclaimed: "Within the fires the spirits are;
Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-49">"My Master," I replied, "by hearing thee
I am more sure; but I surmised already
It might be so, and already wished to ask thee
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-52">Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft
At top, it seems uprising from the pyre
Where was Eteocles with his brother placed."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-55">He answered me: "Within there are tormented
Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together
They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-58">And there within their flame do they lament
The ambush of the horse, which made the door
Whence issued forth the Romans' gentle seed;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-61">Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead
Deidamia still deplores Achilles,
And pain for the Palladium there is borne."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-64">"If they within those sparks possess the power
To speak," I said, "thee, Master, much I pray,
And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-67">That thou make no denial of awaiting
Until the horned flame shall hither come;
Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-70">And he to me: "Worthy is thy entreaty
Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;
But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-73">Leave me to speak, because I have conceived
That which thou wishest; for they might disdain
Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-76">When now the flame had come unto that point,
Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,
After this fashion did I hear him speak:
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-79">"O ye, who are twofold within one fire,
If I deserved of you, while I was living,
If I deserved of you or much or little
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-82">When in the world I wrote the lofty verses,
Do not move on, but one of you declare
Whither, being lost, he went away to die."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-85">Then of the antique flame the greater horn,
Murmuring, began to wave itself about
Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-88">Thereafterward, the summit to and fro
Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,
It uttered forth a voice, and said: "When I
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-91">From Circe had departed, who concealed me
More than a year there near unto Gaeta,
Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-94">Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence
For my old father, nor the due affection
Which joyous should have made Penelope,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-97">Could overcome within me the desire
I had to be experienced of the world,
And of the vice and virtue of mankind;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-100">But I put forth on the high open sea
With one sole ship, and that small company
By which I never had deserted been.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-103">Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,
Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,
And the others which that sea bathes round about.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-106">I and my company were old and slow
When at that narrow passage we arrived
Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-109">That man no farther onward should adventure.
On the right hand behind me left I Seville,
And on the other already had left Ceuta.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-112">'O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand
Perils,' I said, 'have come unto the West,
To this so inconsiderable vigil
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-115">Which is remaining of your senses still
Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,
Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-118">Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;
Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,
But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.'
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-121">So eager did I render my companions,
With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,
That then I hardly could have held them back.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-124">And having turned our stern unto the morning,
We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,
Evermore gaining on the larboard side.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-127">Already all the stars of the other pole
The night beheld, and ours so very low
It did not rise above the ocean floor.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-130">Five times rekindled and as many quenched
Had been the splendour underneath the moon,
Since we had entered into the deep pass,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-133">When there appeared to us a mountain, dim
From distance, and it seemed to me so high
As I had never any one beheld.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-136">Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;
For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,
And smote upon the fore part of the ship.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-139">Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,
At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,
And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvi-142">Until the sea above us closed again."
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XXVII

<p id="inferno-xxvii-1">Already was the flame erect and quiet,
To speak no more, and now departed from us
With the permission of the gentle Poet;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-4">When yet another, which behind it came,
Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top
By a confused sound that issued from it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-7">As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first
With the lament of him, and that was right,
Who with his file had modulated it)
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-10">Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,
That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,
Still it appeared with agony transfixed;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-13">Thus, by not having any way or issue
At first from out the fire, to its own language
Converted were the melancholy words.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-16">But afterwards, when they had gathered way
Up through the point, giving it that vibration
The tongue had given them in their passage out,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-19">We heard it said: "O thou, at whom I aim
My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,
Saying, 'Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,'
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-22">Because I come perchance a little late,
To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;
Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-25">If thou but lately into this blind world
Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,
Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-28">Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,
For I was from the mountains there between
Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-31">I still was downward bent and listening,
When my Conductor touched me on the side,
Saying: "Speak thou: this one a Latian is."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-34">And I, who had beforehand my reply
In readiness, forthwith began to speak:
"O soul, that down below there art concealed,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-37">Romagna thine is not and never has been
Without war in the bosom of its tyrants;
But open war I none have left there now.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-40">Ravenna stands as it long years has stood;
The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,
So that she covers Cervia with her vans.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-43">The city which once made the long resistance,
And of the French a sanguinary heap,
Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-46">Verrucchio's ancient Mastiff and the new,
Who made such bad disposal of Montagna,
Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-49">The cities of Lamone and Santerno
Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,
Who changes sides 'twixt summer-time and winter;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-52">And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,
Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,
Lives between tyranny and a free state.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-55">Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;
Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,
So may thy name hold front there in the world."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-58">After the fire a little more had roared
In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved
This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-61">"If I believed that my reply were made
To one who to the world would e'er return,
This flame without more flickering would stand still;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-64">But inasmuch as never from this depth
Did any one return, if I hear true,
Without the fear of infamy I answer,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-67">I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,
Believing thus begirt to make amends;
And truly my belief had been fulfilled
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-70">But for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,
Who put me back into my former sins;
And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-73">While I was still the form of bone and pulp
My mother gave to me, the deeds I did
Were not those of a lion, but a fox.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-76">The machinations and the covert ways
I knew them all, and practised so their craft,
That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-79">When now unto that portion of mine age
I saw myself arrived, when each one ought
To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-82">That which before had pleased me then displeased me;
And penitent and confessing I surrendered,
Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-85">The Leader of the modern Pharisees
Having a war near unto Lateran,
And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-88">For each one of his enemies was Christian,
And none of them had been to conquer Acre,
Nor merchandising in the Sultan's land,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-91">Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,
In him regarded, nor in me that cord
Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-94">But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester
To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,
So this one sought me out as an adept
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-97">To cure him of the fever of his pride.
Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,
Because his words appeared inebriate.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-100">And then he said: 'Be not thy heart afraid;
Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me
How to raze Palestrina to the ground.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-103">Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,
As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,
The which my predecessor held not dear.'
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-106">Then urged me on his weighty arguments
There, where my silence was the worst advice;
And said I: 'Father, since thou washest me
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-109">Of that sin into which I now must fall,
The promise long with the fulfilment short
Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.'
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-112">Francis came afterward, when I was dead,
For me; but one of the black Cherubim
Said to him: 'Take him not; do me no wrong;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-115">He must come down among my servitors,
Because he gave the fraudulent advice
From which time forth I have been at his hair;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-118">For who repents not cannot be absolved,
Nor can one both repent and will at once,
Because of the contradiction which consents not.'
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-121">O miserable me! how I did shudder
When he seized on me, saying: 'Peradventure
Thou didst not think that I was a logician!'
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-124">He bore me unto Minos, who entwined
Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,
And after he had bitten it in great rage,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-127">Said: 'Of the thievish fire a culprit this;'
Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,
And vested thus in going I bemoan me."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-130">When it had thus completed its recital,
The flame departed uttering lamentations,
Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-133">Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,
Up o'er the crag above another arch,
Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxvii-136">By those who, sowing discord, win their burden.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XXVIII

<p id="inferno-xxviii-1">Who ever could, e'en with untrammelled words,
Tell of the blood and of the wounds in full
Which now I saw, by many times narrating?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-4">Each tongue would for a certainty fall short
By reason of our speech and memory,
That have small room to comprehend so much.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-7">If were again assembled all the people
Which formerly upon the fateful land
Of Puglia were lamenting for their blood
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-10">Shed by the Romans and the lingering war
That of the rings made such illustrious spoils,
As Livy has recorded, who errs not,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-13">With those who felt the agony of blows
By making counterstand to Robert Guiscard,
And all the rest, whose bones are gathered still
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-16">At Ceperano, where a renegade
Was each Apulian, and at Tagliacozzo,
Where without arms the old Alardo conquered,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-19">And one his limb transpierced, and one lopped off,
Should show, it would be nothing to compare
With the disgusting mode of the ninth Bolgia.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-22">A cask by losing centre-piece or cant
Was never shattered so, as I saw one
Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-25">Between his legs were hanging down his entrails;
His heart was visible, and the dismal sack
That maketh excrement of what is eaten.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-28">While I was all absorbed in seeing him,
He looked at me, and opened with his hands
His bosom, saying: "See now how I rend me;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-31">How mutilated, see, is Mahomet;
In front of me doth Ali weeping go,
Cleft in the face from forelock unto chin;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-34">And all the others whom thou here beholdest,
Disseminators of scandal and of schism
While living were, and therefore are cleft thus.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-37">A devil is behind here, who doth cleave us
Thus cruelly, unto the falchion's edge
Putting again each one of all this ream,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-40">When we have gone around the doleful road;
By reason that our wounds are closed again
Ere any one in front of him repass.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-43">But who art thou, that musest on the crag,
Perchance to postpone going to the pain
That is adjudged upon thine accusations?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-46">"Nor death hath reached him yet, nor guilt doth bring him,"
My Master made reply, "to be tormented;
But to procure him full experience,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-49">Me, who am dead, behoves it to conduct him
Down here through Hell, from circle unto circle;
And this is true as that I speak to thee."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-52">More than a hundred were there when they heard him,
Who in the moat stood still to look at me,
Through wonderment oblivious of their torture.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-55">"Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him,
Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun,
If soon he wish not here to follow me,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-58">So with provisions, that no stress of snow
May give the victory to the Novarese,
Which otherwise to gain would not be easy."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-61">After one foot to go away he lifted,
This word did Mahomet say unto me,
Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-64">Another one, who had his throat pierced through,
And nose cut off close underneath the brows,
And had no longer but a single ear,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-67">Staying to look in wonder with the others,
Before the others did his gullet open,
Which outwardly was red in every part,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-70">And said: "O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn,
And whom I once saw up in Latian land,
Unless too great similitude deceive me,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-73">Call to remembrance Pier da Medicina,
If e'er thou see again the lovely plain
That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-76">And make it known to the best two of Fano,
To Messer Guido and Angiolello likewise,
That if foreseeing here be not in vain,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-79">Cast over from their vessel shall they be,
And drowned near unto the Cattolica,
By the betrayal of a tyrant fell.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-82">Between the isles of Cyprus and Majorca
Neptune ne'er yet beheld so great a crime,
Neither of pirates nor Argolic people.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-85">That traitor, who sees only with one eye,
And holds the land, which some one here with me
Would fain be fasting from the vision of,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-88">Will make them come unto a parley with him;
Then will do so, that to Focara's wind
They will not stand in need of vow or prayer."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-91">And I to him: "Show to me and declare,
If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee,
Who is this person of the bitter vision."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-94">Then did he lay his hand upon the jaw
Of one of his companions, and his mouth
Oped, crying: "This is he, and he speaks not.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-97">This one, being banished, every doubt submerged
In Caesar by affirming the forearmed
Always with detriment allowed delay."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-100">O how bewildered unto me appeared,
With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit,
Curio, who in speaking was so bold!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-103">And one, who both his hands dissevered had,
The stumps uplifting through the murky air,
So that the blood made horrible his face,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-106">Cried out: "Thou shalt remember Mosca also,
Who said, alas! 'A thing done has an end!'
Which was an ill seed for the Tuscan people."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-109">"And death unto thy race," thereto I added;
Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,
Departed, like a person sad and crazed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-112">But I remained to look upon the crowd;
And saw a thing which I should be afraid,
Without some further proof, even to recount,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-115">If it were not that conscience reassures me,
That good companion which emboldens man
Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-118">I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,
A trunk without a head walk in like manner
As walked the others of the mournful herd.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-121">And by the hair it held the head dissevered,
Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,
And that upon us gazed and said: "O me!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-124">It of itself made to itself a lamp,
And they were two in one, and one in two;
How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-127">When it was come close to the bridge's foot,
It lifted high its arm with all the head,
To bring more closely unto us its words,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-130">Which were: "Behold now the sore penalty,
Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;
Behold if any be as great as this.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-133">And so that thou may carry news of me,
Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same
Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-136">I made the father and the son rebellious;
Achitophel not more with Absalom
And David did with his accursed goadings.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-139">Because I parted persons so united,
Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!
From its beginning, which is in this trunk.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxviii-142">Thus is observed in me the counterpoise."
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XXIX

<p id="inferno-xxix-1">The many people and the divers wounds
These eyes of mine had so inebriated,
That they were wishful to stand still and weep;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-4">But said Virgilius: "What dost thou still gaze at?
Why is thy sight still riveted down there
Among the mournful, mutilated shades?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-7">Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge;
Consider, if to count them thou believest,
That two-and-twenty miles the valley winds,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-10">And now the moon is underneath our feet;
Henceforth the time allotted us is brief,
And more is to be seen than what thou seest."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-13">"If thou hadst," I made answer thereupon,
"Attended to the cause for which I looked,
Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-16">Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him
I went, already making my reply,
And superadding: "In that cavern where
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-19">I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,
I think a spirit of my blood laments
The sin which down below there costs so much."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-22">Then said the Master: "Be no longer broken
Thy thought from this time forward upon him;
Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-25">For him I saw below the little bridge,
Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger
Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-28">So wholly at that time wast thou impeded
By him who formerly held Altaforte,
Thou didst not look that way; so he departed."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-31">"O my Conductor, his own violent death,
Which is not yet avenged for him," I said,
"By any who is sharer in the shame,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-34">Made him disdainful; whence he went away,
As I imagine, without speaking to me,
And thereby made me pity him the more."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-37">Thus did we speak as far as the first place
Upon the crag, which the next valley shows
Down to the bottom, if there were more light.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-40">When we were now right over the last cloister
Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers
Could manifest themselves unto our sight,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-43">Divers lamentings pierced me through and through,
Which with compassion had their arrows barbed,
Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-46">What pain would be, if from the hospitals
Of Valdichiana, 'twixt July and September,
And of Maremma and Sardinia
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-49">All the diseases in one moat were gathered,
Such was it here, and such a stench came from it
As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-52">We had descended on the furthest bank
From the long crag, upon the left hand still,
And then more vivid was my power of sight
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-55">Down tow'rds the bottom, where the ministress
Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,
Punishes forgers, which she here records.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-58">I do not think a sadder sight to see
Was in Aegina the whole people sick,
(When was the air so full of pestilence,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-61">The animals, down to the little worm,
All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,
According as the poets have affirmed,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-64">Were from the seed of ants restored again,)
Than was it to behold through that dark valley
The spirits languishing in divers heaps.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-67">This on the belly, that upon the back
One of the other lay, and others crawling
Shifted themselves along the dismal road.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-70">We step by step went onward without speech,
Gazing upon and listening to the sick
Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-73">I saw two sitting leaned against each other,
As leans in heating platter against platter,
From head to foot bespotted o'er with scabs;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-76">And never saw I plied a currycomb
By stable-boy for whom his master waits,
Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-79">As every one was plying fast the bite
Of nails upon himself, for the great rage
Of itching which no other succour had.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-82">And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,
In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,
Or any other fish that has them largest.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-85">"O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,"
Began my Leader unto one of them,
"And makest of them pincers now and then,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-88">Tell me if any Latian is with those
Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee
To all eternity unto this work."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-91">"Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,
Both of us here," one weeping made reply;
"But who art thou, that questionest about us?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-94">And said the Guide: "One am I who descends
Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,
And I intend to show Hell unto him."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-97">Then broken was their mutual support,
And trembling each one turned himself to me,
With others who had heard him by rebound.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-100">Wholly to me did the good Master gather,
Saying: "Say unto them whate'er thou wishest."
And I began, since he would have it so:
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-103">"So may your memory not steal away
In the first world from out the minds of men,
But so may it survive 'neath many suns,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-106">Say to me who ye are, and of what people;
Let not your foul and loathsome punishment
Make you afraid to show yourselves to me."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-109">"I of Arezzo was," one made reply,
"And Albert of Siena had me burned;
But what I died for does not bring me here.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-112">'Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,
That I could rise by flight into the air,
And he who had conceit, but little wit,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-115">Would have me show to him the art; and only
Because no Daedalus I made him, made me
Be burned by one who held him as his son.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-118">But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,
For alchemy, which in the world I practised,
Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-121">And to the Poet said I: "Now was ever
So vain a people as the Sienese?
Not for a certainty the French by far."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-124">Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,
Replied unto my speech: "Taking out Stricca,
Who knew the art of moderate expenses,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-127">And Niccolo, who the luxurious use
Of cloves discovered earliest of all
Within that garden where such seed takes root;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-130">And taking out the band, among whom squandered
Caccia d'Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,
And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-133">But, that thou know who thus doth second thee
Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye
Tow'rds me, so that my face well answer thee,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-136">And thou shalt see I am Capocchio's shade,
Who metals falsified by alchemy;
Thou must remember, if I well descry thee,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxix-139">How I a skilful ape of nature was."
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XXX

<p id="inferno-xxx-1">'Twas at the time when Juno was enraged,
For Semele, against the Theban blood,
As she already more than once had shown,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-4">So reft of reason Athamas became,
That, seeing his own wife with children twain
Walking encumbered upon either hand,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-7">He cried: "Spread out the nets, that I may take
The lioness and her whelps upon the passage;"
And then extended his unpitying claws,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-10">Seizing the first, who had the name Learchus,
And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock;
And she, with the other burthen, drowned herself;--
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-13">And at the time when fortune downward hurled
The Trojan's arrogance, that all things dared,
So that the king was with his kingdom crushed,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-16">Hecuba sad, disconsolate, and captive,
When lifeless she beheld Polyxena,
And of her Polydorus on the shore
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-19">Of ocean was the dolorous one aware,
Out of her senses like a dog she barked,
So much the anguish had her mind distorted;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-22">But not of Thebes the furies nor the Trojan
Were ever seen in any one so cruel
In goading beasts, and much more human members,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-25">As I beheld two shadows pale and naked,
Who, biting, in the manner ran along
That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-28">One to Capocchio came, and by the nape
Seized with its teeth his neck, so that in dragging
It made his belly grate the solid bottom.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-31">And the Aretine, who trembling had remained,
Said to me: "That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi,
And raving goes thus harrying other people."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-34">"O," said I to him, "so may not the other
Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee
To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-37">And he to me: "That is the ancient ghost
Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became
Beyond all rightful love her father's lover.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-40">She came to sin with him after this manner,
By counterfeiting of another's form;
As he who goeth yonder undertook,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-43">That he might gain the lady of the herd,
To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,
Making a will and giving it due form."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-46">And after the two maniacs had passed
On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back
To look upon the other evil-born.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-49">I saw one made in fashion of a lute,
If he had only had the groin cut off
Just at the point at which a man is forked.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-52">The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions
The limbs with humours, which it ill concocts,
That the face corresponds not to the belly,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-55">Compelled him so to hold his lips apart
As does the hectic, who because of thirst
One tow'rds the chin, the other upward turns.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-58">"O ye, who without any torment are,
And why I know not, in the world of woe,"
He said to us, "behold, and be attentive
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-61">Unto the misery of Master Adam;
I had while living much of what I wished,
And now, alas! a drop of water crave.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-64">The rivulets, that from the verdant hills
Of Cassentin descend down into Arno,
Making their channels to be cold and moist,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-67">Ever before me stand, and not in vain;
For far more doth their image dry me up
Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-70">The rigid justice that chastises me
Draweth occasion from the place in which
I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-73">There is Romena, where I counterfeited
The currency imprinted with the Baptist,
For which I left my body burned above.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-76">But if I here could see the tristful soul
Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother,
For Branda's fount I would not give the sight.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-79">One is within already, if the raving
Shades that are going round about speak truth;
But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-82">If I were only still so light, that in
A hundred years I could advance one inch,
I had already started on the way,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-85">Seeking him out among this squalid folk,
Although the circuit be eleven miles,
And be not less than half a mile across.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-88">For them am I in such a family;
They did induce me into coining florins,
Which had three carats of impurity."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-91">And I to him: "Who are the two poor wretches
That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter,
Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-94">"I found them here," replied he, "when I rained
Into this chasm, and since they have not turned,
Nor do I think they will for evermore.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-97">One the false woman is who accused Joseph,
The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy;
From acute fever they send forth such reek."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-100">And one of them, who felt himself annoyed
At being, peradventure, named so darkly,
Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-103">It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;
And Master Adam smote him in the face,
With arm that did not seem to be less hard,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-106">Saying to him: "Although be taken from me
All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,
I have an arm unfettered for such need."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-109">Whereat he answer made: "When thou didst go
Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready:
But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-112">The dropsical: "Thou sayest true in that;
But thou wast not so true a witness there,
Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-115">"If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,"
Said Sinon; "and for one fault I am here,
And thou for more than any other demon."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-118">"Remember, perjurer, about the horse,"
He made reply who had the swollen belly,
"And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-121">"Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks
Thy tongue," the Greek said, "and the putrid water
That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-124">Then the false-coiner: "So is gaping wide
Thy mouth for speaking evil, as 'tis wont;
Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-127">Thou hast the burning and the head that aches,
And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus
Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-130">In listening to them was I wholly fixed,
When said the Master to me: "Now just look,
For little wants it that I quarrel with thee."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-133">When him I heard in anger speak to me,
I turned me round towards him with such shame
That still it eddies through my memory.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-136">And as he is who dreams of his own harm,
Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,
So that he craves what is, as if it were not;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-139">Such I became, not having power to speak,
For to excuse myself I wished, and still
Excused myself, and did not think I did it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-142">"Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,"
The Master said, "than this of thine has been;
Therefore thyself disburden of all sadness,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-145">And make account that I am aye beside thee,
If e'er it come to pass that fortune bring thee
Where there are people in a like dispute;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxx-148">For a base wish it is to wish to hear it."
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XXXI

<p id="inferno-xxxi-1">One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me,
So that it tinged the one cheek and the other,
And then held out to me the medicine;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-4">Thus do I hear that once Achilles' spear,
His and his father's, used to be the cause
First of a sad and then a gracious boon.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-7">We turned our backs upon the wretched valley,
Upon the bank that girds it round about,
Going across it without any speech.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-10">There it was less than night, and less than day,
So that my sight went little in advance;
But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-13">So loud it would have made each thunder faint,
Which, counter to it following its way,
Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-16">After the dolorous discomfiture
When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,
So terribly Orlando sounded not.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-19">Short while my head turned thitherward I held
When many lofty towers I seemed to see,
Whereat I: "Master, say, what town is this?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-22">And he to me: "Because thou peerest forth
Athwart the darkness at too great a distance,
It happens that thou errest in thy fancy.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-25">Well shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there,
How much the sense deceives itself by distance;
Therefore a little faster spur thee on."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-28">Then tenderly he took me by the hand,
And said: "Before we farther have advanced,
That the reality may seem to thee
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-31">Less strange, know that these are not towers, but giants,
And they are in the well, around the bank,
From navel downward, one and all of them."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-34">As, when the fog is vanishing away,
Little by little doth the sight refigure
Whate'er the mist that crowds the air conceals,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-37">So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,
More and more near approaching tow'rd the verge,
My error fled, and fear came over me;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-40">Because as on its circular parapets
Montereggione crowns itself with towers,
E'en thus the margin which surrounds the well
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-43">With one half of their bodies turreted
The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces
E'en now from out the heavens when he thunders.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-46">And I of one already saw the face,
Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,
And down along his sides both of the arms.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-49">Certainly Nature, when she left the making
Of animals like these, did well indeed,
By taking such executors from Mars;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-52">And if of elephants and whales she doth not
Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly
More just and more discreet will hold her for it;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-55">For where the argument of intellect
Is added unto evil will and power,
No rampart can the people make against it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-58">His face appeared to me as long and large
As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter's,
And in proportion were the other bones;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-61">So that the margin, which an apron was
Down from the middle, showed so much of him
Above it, that to reach up to his hair
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-64">Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;
For I beheld thirty great palms of him
Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-67">"Raphael mai amech izabi almi,"
Began to clamour the ferocious mouth,
To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-70">And unto him my Guide: "Soul idiotic,
Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that,
When wrath or other passion touches thee.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-73">Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt
Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul,
And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-76">Then said to me: "He doth himself accuse;
This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought
One language in the world is not still used.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-79">Here let us leave him and not speak in vain;
For even such to him is every language
As his to others, which to none is known."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-82">Therefore a longer journey did we make,
Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft
We found another far more fierce and large.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-85">In binding him, who might the master be
I cannot say; but he had pinioned close
Behind the right arm, and in front the other,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-88">With chains, that held him so begirt about
From the neck down, that on the part uncovered
It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-91">"This proud one wished to make experiment
Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,"
My Leader said, "whence he has such a guerdon.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-94">Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess.
What time the giants terrified the gods;
The arms he wielded never more he moves."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-97">And I to him: "If possible, I should wish
That of the measureless Briareus
These eyes of mine might have experience."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-100">Whence he replied: "Thou shalt behold Antaeus
Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,
Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-103">Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,
And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,
Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-106">There never was an earthquake of such might
That it could shake a tower so violently,
As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-109">Then was I more afraid of death than ever,
For nothing more was needful than the fear,
If I had not beheld the manacles.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-112">Then we proceeded farther in advance,
And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells
Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-115">"O thou, who in the valley fortunate,
Which Scipio the heir of glory made,
When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-118">Once brought'st a thousand lions for thy prey,
And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war
Among thy brothers, some it seems still think
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-121">The sons of Earth the victory would have gained:
Place us below, nor be disdainful of it,
There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-124">Make us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus;
This one can give of that which here is longed for;
Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-127">Still in the world can he restore thy fame;
Because he lives, and still expects long life,
If to itself Grace call him not untimely."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-130">So said the Master; and in haste the other
His hands extended and took up my Guide,--
Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-133">Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,
Said unto me: "Draw nigh, that I may take thee;"
Then of himself and me one bundle made.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-136">As seems the Carisenda, to behold
Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud
Above it so that opposite it hangs;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-139">Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood
Watching to see him stoop, and then it was
I could have wished to go some other way.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-142">But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up
Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;
Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxi-145">But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XXXII

<p id="inferno-xxxii-1">If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous,
As were appropriate to the dismal hole
Down upon which thrust all the other rocks,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-4">I would press out the juice of my conception
More fully; but because I have them not,
Not without fear I bring myself to speak;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-7">For 'tis no enterprise to take in jest,
To sketch the bottom of all the universe,
Nor for a tongue that cries Mamma and Babbo.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-10">But may those Ladies help this verse of mine,
Who helped Amphion in enclosing Thebes,
That from the fact the word be not diverse.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-13">O rabble ill-begotten above all,
Who're in the place to speak of which is hard,
'Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-16">When we were down within the darksome well,
Beneath the giant's feet, but lower far,
And I was scanning still the lofty wall,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-19">I heard it said to me: "Look how thou steppest!
Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet
The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-22">Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me
And underfoot a lake, that from the frost
The semblance had of glass, and not of water.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-25">So thick a veil ne'er made upon its current
In winter-time Danube in Austria,
Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-28">As there was here; so that if Tambernich
Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,
E'en at the edge 'twould not have given a creak.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-31">And as to croak the frog doth place himself
With muzzle out of water,--when is dreaming
Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl,--
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-34">Livid, as far down as where shame appears,
Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,
Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-37">Each one his countenance held downward bent;
From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart
Among them witness of itself procures.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-40">When round about me somewhat I had looked,
I downward turned me, and saw two so close,
The hair upon their heads together mingled.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-43">"Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,"
I said, "who are you;" and they bent their necks,
And when to me their faces they had lifted,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-46">Their eyes, which first were only moist within,
Gushed o'er the eyelids, and the frost congealed
The tears between, and locked them up again.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-49">Clamp never bound together wood with wood
So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,
Butted together, so much wrath o'ercame them.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-52">And one, who had by reason of the cold
Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,
Said: "Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-55">If thou desire to know who these two are,
The valley whence Bisenzio descends
Belonged to them and to their father Albert.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-58">They from one body came, and all Caina
Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade
More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-61">Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow
At one and the same blow by Arthur's hand;
Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-64">So with his head I see no farther forward,
And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;
Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-67">And that thou put me not to further speech,
Know that I Camicion de' Pazzi was,
And wait Carlino to exonerate me."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-70">Then I beheld a thousand faces, made
Purple with cold; whence o'er me comes a shudder,
And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-73">And while we were advancing tow'rds the middle,
Where everything of weight unites together,
And I was shivering in the eternal shade,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-76">Whether 'twere will, or destiny, or chance,
I know not; but in walking 'mong the heads
I struck my foot hard in the face of one.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-79">Weeping he growled: "Why dost thou trample me?
Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance
of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-82">And I: "My Master, now wait here for me,
That I through him may issue from a doubt;
Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-85">The Leader stopped; and to that one I said
Who was blaspheming vehemently still:
"Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-88">"Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora
Smiting," replied he, "other people's cheeks,
So that, if thou wert living, 'twere too much?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-91">"Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,"
Was my response, "if thou demandest fame,
That 'mid the other notes thy name I place."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-94">And he to me: "For the reverse I long;
Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;
For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-97">Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,
And said: "It must needs be thou name thyself,
Or not a hair remain upon thee here."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-100">Whence he to me: "Though thou strip off my hair,
I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,
If on my head a thousand times thou fall."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-103">I had his hair in hand already twisted,
And more than one shock of it had pulled out,
He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-106">When cried another: "What doth ail thee, Bocca?
Is't not enough to clatter with thy jaws,
But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-109">"Now," said I, "I care not to have thee speak,
Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame
I will report of thee veracious news."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-112">"Begone," replied he, "and tell what thou wilt,
But be not silent, if thou issue hence,
Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-115">He weepeth here the silver of the French;
'I saw,' thus canst thou phrase it, 'him of Duera
There where the sinners stand out in the cold.'
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-118">If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,
Thou hast beside thee him of Beccaria,
Of whom the gorget Florence slit asunder;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-121">Gianni del Soldanier, I think, may be
Yonder with Ganellon, and Tebaldello
Who oped Faenza when the people slep."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-124">Already we had gone away from him,
When I beheld two frozen in one hole,
So that one head a hood was to the other;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-127">And even as bread through hunger is devoured,
The uppermost on the other set his teeth,
There where the brain is to the nape united.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-130">Not in another fashion Tydeus gnawed
The temples of Menalippus in disdain,
Than that one did the skull and the other things.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-133">"O thou, who showest by such bestial sign
Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,
Tell me the wherefore," said I, "with this compact,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-136">That if thou rightfully of him complain,
In knowing who ye are, and his transgression,
I in the world above repay thee for it,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxii-139">If that wherewith I speak be not dried up."
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XXXIII

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-1">His mouth uplifted from his grim repast,
That sinner, wiping it upon the hair
Of the same head that he behind had wasted.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-4">Then he began: "Thou wilt that I renew
The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already
To think of only, ere I speak of it;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-7">But if my words be seed that may bear fruit
Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,
Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-10">I know not who thou art, nor by what mode
Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine
Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-13">Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,
And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;
Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-16">That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,
Trusting in him I was made prisoner,
And after put to death, I need not say;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-19">But ne'ertheless what thou canst not have heard,
That is to say, how cruel was my death,
Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-22">A narrow perforation in the mew,
Which bears because of me the title of Famine,
And in which others still must be locked up,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-25">Had shown me through its opening many moons
Already, when I dreamed the evil dream
Which of the future rent for me the veil.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-28">This one appeared to me as lord and master,
Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain
For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-31">With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,
Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi
He had sent out before him to the front.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-34">After brief course seemed unto me forespent
The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes
It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-37">When I before the morrow was awake,
Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons
Who with me were, and asking after bread.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-40">Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,
Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,
And weep'st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-43">They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh
At which our food used to be brought to us,
And through his dream was each one apprehensive;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-46">And I heard locking up the under door
Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word
I gazed into the faces of my sons.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-49">I wept not, I within so turned to stone;
They wept; and darling little Anselm mine
Said: 'Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?'
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-52">Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made
All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,
Until another sun rose on the world.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-55">As now a little glimmer made its way
Into the dolorous prison, and I saw
Upon four faces my own very aspect,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-58">Both of my hands in agony I bit;
And, thinking that I did it from desire
Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-61">And said they: 'Father, much less pain 'twill give us
If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us
With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.'
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-64">I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.
That day we all were silent, and the next.
Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-67">When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo
Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,
Saying, 'My father, why dost thou not help me?'
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-70">And there he died; and, as thou seest me,
I saw the three fall, one by one, between
The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-73">Already blind, to groping over each,
And three days called them after they were dead;
Then hunger did what sorrow could not do."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-76">When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,
The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,
Which, as a dog's, upon the bone were strong.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-79">Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people
Of the fair land there where the 'Si' doth sound,
Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-82">Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,
And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno
That every person in thee it may drown!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-85">For if Count Ugolino had the fame
Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,
Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-88">Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!
Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,
And the other two my song doth name above!
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-91">We passed still farther onward, where the ice
Another people ruggedly enswathes,
Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-94">Weeping itself there does not let them weep,
And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes
Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-97">Because the earliest tears a cluster form,
And, in the manner of a crystal visor,
Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-100">And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,
Because of cold all sensibility
Its station had abandoned in my face,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-103">Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;
Whence I: "My Master, who sets this in motion?
Is not below here every vapour quenched?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-106">Whence he to me: "Full soon shalt thou be where
Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,
Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-109">And one of the wretches of the frozen crust
Cried out to us: "O souls so merciless
That the last post is given unto you,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-112">Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I
May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart
A little, e'er the weeping recongeal."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-115">Whence I to him: "If thou wouldst have me help thee
Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,
May I go to the bottom of the ice."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-118">Then he replied: "I am Friar Alberigo;
He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,
Who here a date am getting for my fig."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-121">"O," said I to him, "now art thou, too, dead?"
And he to me: "How may my body fare
Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-124">Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,
That oftentimes the soul descendeth here
Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-127">And, that thou mayest more willingly remove
From off my countenance these glassy tears,
Know that as soon as any soul betrays
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-130">As I have done, his body by a demon
Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,
Until his time has wholly been revolved.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-133">Itself down rushes into such a cistern;
And still perchance above appears the body
Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-136">This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;
It is Ser Branca d' Oria, and many years
Have passed away since he was thus locked up."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-139">"I think," said I to him, "thou dost deceive me;
For Branca d' Oria is not dead as yet,
And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-142">"In moat above," said he, "of Malebranche,
There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,
As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-145">When this one left a devil in his stead
In his own body and one near of kin,
Who made together with him the betrayal.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-148">But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,
Open mine eyes;"--and open them I did not,
And to be rude to him was courtesy.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-151">Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance
With every virtue, full of every vice
Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-154">For with the vilest spirit of Romagna
I found of you one such, who for his deeds
In soul already in Cocytus bathes,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiii-157">And still above in body seems alive!
</p>

## Inferno - Canto XXXIV

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-1">"'Vexilla Regis prodeunt Inferni'
Towards us; therefore look in front of thee,"
My Master said, "if thou discernest him."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-4">As, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when
Our hemisphere is darkening into night,
Appears far off a mill the wind is turning,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-7">Methought that such a building then I saw;
And, for the wind, I drew myself behind
My Guide, because there was no other shelter.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-10">Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it,
There where the shades were wholly covered up,
And glimmered through like unto straws in glass.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-13">Some prone are lying, others stand erect,
This with the head, and that one with the soles;
Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-16">When in advance so far we had proceeded,
That it my Master pleased to show to me
The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-19">He from before me moved and made me stop,
Saying: "Behold Dis, and behold the place
Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-22">How frozen I became and powerless then,
Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,
Because all language would be insufficient.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-25">I did not die, and I alive remained not;
Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,
What I became, being of both deprived.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-28">The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous
From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;
And better with a giant I compare
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-31">Than do the giants with those arms of his;
Consider now how great must be that whole,
Which unto such a part conforms itself.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-34">Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,
And lifted up his brow against his Maker,
Well may proceed from him all tribulation.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-37">O, what a marvel it appeared to me,
When I beheld three faces on his head!
The one in front, and that vermilion was;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-40">Two were the others, that were joined with this
Above the middle part of either shoulder,
And they were joined together at the crest;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-43">And the right-hand one seemed 'twixt white and yellow;
The left was such to look upon as those
Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-46">Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,
Such as befitting were so great a bird;
Sails of the sea I never saw so large.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-49">No feathers had they, but as of a bat
Their fashion was; and he was waving them,
So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-52">Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.
With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins
Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-55">At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching
A sinner, in the manner of a brake,
So that he three of them tormented thus.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-58">To him in front the biting was as naught
Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine
Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-61">"That soul up there which has the greatest pain,"
The Master said, "is Judas Iscariot;
With head inside, he plies his legs without.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-64">Of the two others, who head downward are,
The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;
See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-67">And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.
But night is reascending, and 'tis time
That we depart, for we have seen the whole."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-70">As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,
And he the vantage seized of time and place,
And when the wings were opened wide apart,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-73">He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;
From fell to fell descended downward then
Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-76">When we were come to where the thigh revolves
Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,
The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-79">Turned round his head where he had had his legs,
And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,
So that to Hell I thought we were returning.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-82">"Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,"
The Master said, panting as one fatigued,
"Must we perforce depart from so much evil."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-85">Then through the opening of a rock he issued,
And down upon the margin seated me;
Then tow'rds me he outstretched his wary step.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-88">I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see
Lucifer in the same way I had left him;
And I beheld him upward hold his legs.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-91">And if I then became disquieted,
Let stolid people think who do not see
What the point is beyond which I had passed.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-94">"Rise up," the Master said, "upon thy feet;
The way is long, and difficult the road,
And now the sun to middle-tierce returns."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-97">It was not any palace corridor
There where we were, but dungeon natural,
With floor uneven and unease of light.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-100">"Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,
My Master," said I when I had arisen,
"To draw me from an error speak a little;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-103">Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed
Thus upside down? and how in such short time
From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?"
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-106">And he to me: "Thou still imaginest
Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped
The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-109">That side thou wast, so long as I descended;
When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point
To which things heavy draw from every side,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-112">And now beneath the hemisphere art come
Opposite that which overhangs the vast
Dry-land, and 'neath whose cope was put to death
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-115">The Man who without sin was born and lived.
Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere
Which makes the other face of the Judecca.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-118">Here it is morn when it is evening there;
And he who with his hair a stairway made us
Still fixed remaineth as he was before.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-121">Upon this side he fell down out of heaven;
And all the land, that whilom here emerged,
For fear of him made of the sea a veil,
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-124">And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure
To flee from him, what on this side appears
Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled."
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-127">A place there is below, from Beelzebub
As far receding as the tomb extends,
Which not by sight is known, but by the sound
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-130">Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth
Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed
With course that winds about and slightly falls.
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-133">The Guide and I into that hidden road
Now entered, to return to the bright world;
And without care of having any rest
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-136">We mounted up, he first and I the second,
Till I beheld through a round aperture
Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;
</p>

<p id="inferno-xxxiv-139">Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.
</p>

# PURGATORIO

## Purgatorio - Canto I

<p id="purgatorio-i-1">To run o'er better waters hoists its sail
The little vessel of my genius now,
That leaves behind itself a sea so cruel;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-4">And of that second kingdom will I sing
Wherein the human spirit doth purge itself,
And to ascend to heaven becometh worthy.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-7">But let dead Poesy here rise again,
O holy Muses, since that I am yours,
And here Calliope somewhat ascend,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-10">My song accompanying with that sound,
Of which the miserable magpies felt
The blow so great, that they despaired of pardon.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-13">Sweet colour of the oriental sapphire,
That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect
Of the pure air, as far as the first circle,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-16">Unto mine eyes did recommence delight
Soon as I issued forth from the dead air,
Which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-19">The beauteous planet, that to love incites,
Was making all the orient to laugh,
Veiling the Fishes that were in her escort.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-22">To the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind
Upon the other pole, and saw four stars
Ne'er seen before save by the primal people.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-25">Rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven.
O thou septentrional and widowed site,
Because thou art deprived of seeing these!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-28">When from regarding them I had withdrawn,
Turning a little to the other pole,
There where the Wain had disappeared already,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-31">I saw beside me an old man alone,
Worthy of so much reverence in his look,
That more owes not to father any son.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-34">A long beard and with white hair intermingled
He wore, in semblance like unto the tresses,
Of which a double list fell on his breast.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-37">The rays of the four consecrated stars
Did so adorn his countenance with light,
That him I saw as were the sun before him.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-40">"Who are you? ye who, counter the blind river,
Have fled away from the eternal prison?"
Moving those venerable plumes, he said:
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-43">"Who guided you? or who has been your lamp
In issuing forth out of the night profound,
That ever black makes the infernal valley?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-46">The laws of the abyss, are they thus broken?
Or is there changed in heaven some council new,
That being damned ye come unto my crags?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-49">Then did my Leader lay his grasp upon me,
And with his words, and with his hands and signs,
Reverent he made in me my knees and brow;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-52">Then answered him: "I came not of myself;
A Lady from Heaven descended, at whose prayers
I aided this one with my company.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-55">But since it is thy will more be unfolded
Of our condition, how it truly is,
Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-58">This one has never his last evening seen,
But by his folly was so near to it
That very little time was there to turn.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-61">As I have said, I unto him was sent
To rescue him, and other way was none
Than this to which I have myself betaken.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-64">I've shown him all the people of perdition,
And now those spirits I intend to show
Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-67">How I have brought him would be long to tell thee.
Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me
To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-70">Now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming;
He seeketh Liberty, which is so dear,
As knoweth he who life for her refuses.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-73">Thou know'st it; since, for her, to thee not bitter
Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave
The vesture, that will shine so, the great day.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-76">By us the eternal edicts are not broken;
Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me;
But of that circle I, where are the chaste
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-79">Eyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee,
O holy breast, to hold her as thine own;
For her love, then, incline thyself to us.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-82">Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go;
I will take back this grace from thee to her,
If to be mentioned there below thou deignest."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-85">"Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes
While I was on the other side," then said he,
"That every grace she wished of me I granted;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-88">Now that she dwells beyond the evil river,
She can no longer move me, by that law
Which, when I issued forth from there, was made.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-91">But if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee,
As thou dost say, no flattery is needful;
Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-94">Go, then, and see thou gird this one about
With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,
So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-97">For 'twere not fitting that the eye o'ercast
By any mist should go before the first
Angel, who is of those of Paradise.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-100">This little island round about its base
Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it,
Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-103">No other plant that putteth forth the leaf,
Or that doth indurate, can there have life,
Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-106">Thereafter be not this way your return;
The sun, which now is rising, will direct you
To take the mount by easier ascent."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-109">With this he vanished; and I raised me up
Without a word, and wholly drew myself
Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-112">And he began: "Son, follow thou my steps;
Let us turn back, for on this side declines
The plain unto its lower boundaries."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-115">The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour
Which fled before it, so that from afar
I recognised the trembling of the sea.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-118">Along the solitary plain we went
As one who unto the lost road returns,
And till he finds it seems to go in vain.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-121">As soon as we were come to where the dew
Fights with the sun, and, being in a part
Where shadow falls, little evaporates,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-124">Both of his hands upon the grass outspread
In gentle manner did my Master place;
Whence I, who of his action was aware,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-127">Extended unto him my tearful cheeks;
There did he make in me uncovered wholly
That hue which Hell had covered up in me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-130">Then came we down upon the desert shore
Which never yet saw navigate its waters
Any that afterward had known return.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-133">There he begirt me as the other pleased;
O marvellous! for even as he culled
The humble plant, such it sprang up again
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-i-136">Suddenly there where he uprooted it.
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto II

<p id="purgatorio-ii-1">Already had the sun the horizon reached
Whose circle of meridian covers o'er
Jerusalem with its most lofty point,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-4">And night that opposite to him revolves
Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales
That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-7">So that the white and the vermilion cheeks
Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,
By too great age were changing into orange.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-10">We still were on the border of the sea,
Like people who are thinking of their road,
Who go in heart and with the body stay;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-13">And lo! as when, upon the approach of morning,
Through the gross vapours Mars grows fiery red
Down in the West upon the ocean floor,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-16">Appeared to me--may I again behold it!--
A light along the sea so swiftly coming,
Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-19">From which when I a little had withdrawn
Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,
Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-22">Then on each side of it appeared to me
I knew not what of white, and underneath it
Little by little there came forth another.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-25">My Master yet had uttered not a word
While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;
But when he clearly recognised the pilot,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-28">He cried: "Make haste, make haste to bow the knee!
Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!
Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-31">See how he scorneth human arguments,
So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail
Than his own wings, between so distant shores.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-34">See how he holds them pointed up to heaven,
Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,
That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-37">Then as still nearer and more near us came
The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,
So that near by the eye could not endure him,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-40">But down I cast it; and he came to shore
With a small vessel, very swift and light,
So that the water swallowed naught thereof.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-43">Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot;
Beatitude seemed written in his face,
And more than a hundred spirits sat within.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-46">"In exitu Israel de Aegypto!"
They chanted all together in one voice,
With whatso in that psalm is after written.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-49">Then made he sign of holy rood upon them,
Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,
And he departed swiftly as he came.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-52">The throng which still remained there unfamiliar
Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing,
As one who in new matters makes essay.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-55">On every side was darting forth the day.
The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts
From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-58">When the new people lifted up their faces
Towards us, saying to us: "If ye know,
Show us the way to go unto the mountain."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-61">And answer made Virgilius: "Ye believe
Perchance that we have knowledge of this place,
But we are strangers even as yourselves.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-64">Just now we came, a little while before you,
Another way, which was so rough and steep,
That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-67">The souls who had, from seeing me draw breath,
Become aware that I was still alive,
Pallid in their astonishment became;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-70">And as to messenger who bears the olive
The people throng to listen to the news,
And no one shows himself afraid of crowding,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-73">So at the sight of me stood motionless
Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if
Oblivious to go and make them fair.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-76">One from among them saw I coming forward,
As to embrace me, with such great affection,
That it incited me to do the like.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-79">O empty shadows, save in aspect only!
Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,
As oft returned with them to my own breast!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-82">I think with wonder I depicted me;
Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew;
And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-85">Gently it said that I should stay my steps;
Then knew I who it was, and I entreated
That it would stop awhile to speak with me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-88">It made reply to me: "Even as I loved thee
In mortal body, so I love thee free;
Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-91">"My own Casella! to return once more
There where I am, I make this journey," said I;
"But how from thee has so much time be taken?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-94">And he to me: "No outrage has been done me,
If he who takes both when and whom he pleases
Has many times denied to me this passage,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-97">For of a righteous will his own is made.
He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken
Whoever wished to enter with all peace;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-100">Whence I, who now had turned unto that shore
Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow,
Benignantly by him have been received.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-103">Unto that outlet now his wing is pointed,
Because for evermore assemble there
Those who tow'rds Acheron do not descend."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-106">And I: "If some new law take not from thee
Memory or practice of the song of love,
Which used to quiet in me all my longings,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-109">Thee may it please to comfort therewithal
Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body
Hitherward coming is so much distressed."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-112">"Love, that within my mind discourses with me,"
Forthwith began he so melodiously,
The melody within me still is sounding.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-115">My Master, and myself, and all that people
Which with him were, appeared as satisfied
As if naught else might touch the mind of any.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-118">We all of us were moveless and attentive
Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man,
Exclaiming: "What is this, ye laggard spirits?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-121">What negligence, what standing still is this?
Run to the mountain to strip off the slough,
That lets not God be manifest to you."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-124">Even as when, collecting grain or tares,
The doves, together at their pasture met,
Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-127">If aught appear of which they are afraid,
Upon a sudden leave their food alone,
Because they are assailed by greater care;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-130">So that fresh company did I behold
The song relinquish, and go tow'rds the hill,
As one who goes, and knows not whitherward;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ii-133">Nor was our own departure less in haste.
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto III

<p id="purgatorio-iii-1">Inasmuch as the instantaneous flight
Had scattered them asunder o'er the plain,
Turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-4">I pressed me close unto my faithful comrade,
And how without him had I kept my course?
Who would have led me up along the mountain?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-7">He seemed to me within himself remorseful;
O noble conscience, and without a stain,
How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-10">After his feet had laid aside the haste
Which mars the dignity of every act,
My mind, that hitherto had been restrained,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-13">Let loose its faculties as if delighted,
And I my sight directed to the hill
That highest tow'rds the heaven uplifts itself.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-16">The sun, that in our rear was flaming red,
Was broken in front of me into the figure
Which had in me the stoppage of its rays;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-19">Unto one side I turned me, with the fear
Of being left alone, when I beheld
Only in front of me the ground obscured.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-22">"Why dost thou still mistrust?" my Comforter
Began to say to me turned wholly round;
"Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-25">'Tis evening there already where is buried
The body within which I cast a shadow;
'Tis from Brundusium ta'en, and Naples has it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-28">Now if in front of me no shadow fall,
Marvel not at it more than at the heavens,
Because one ray impedeth not another
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-31">To suffer torments, both of cold and heat,
Bodies like this that Power provides, which wills
That how it works be not unveiled to us.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-34">Insane is he who hopeth that our reason
Can traverse the illimitable way,
Which the one Substance in three Persons follows!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-37">Mortals, remain contented at the 'Quia;'
For if ye had been able to see all,
No need there were for Mary to give birth;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-40">And ye have seen desiring without fruit,
Those whose desire would have been quieted,
Which evermore is given them for a grief.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-43">I speak of Aristotle and of Plato,
And many others;"--and here bowed his head,
And more he said not, and remained disturbed.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-46">We came meanwhile unto the mountain's foot;
There so precipitate we found the rock,
That nimble legs would there have been in vain.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-49">'Twixt Lerici and Turbia, the most desert,
The most secluded pathway is a stair
Easy and open, if compared with that.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-52">"Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill
Slopes down," my Master said, his footsteps staying,
"So that who goeth without wings may mount?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-55">And while he held his eyes upon the ground
Examining the nature of the path,
And I was looking up around the rock,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-58">On the left hand appeared to me a throng
Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction,
And did not seem to move, they came so slowly.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-61">"Lift up thine eyes," I to the Master said;
"Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel,
If thou of thine own self can have it not."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-64">Then he looked at me, and with frank expression
Replied: "Let us go there, for they come slowly,
And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-67">Still was that people as far off from us,
After a thousand steps of ours I say,
As a good thrower with his hand would reach,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-70">When they all crowded unto the hard masses
Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close,
As he stands still to look who goes in doubt.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-73">"O happy dead!  O spirits elect already!"
Virgilius made beginning, "by that peace
Which I believe is waiting for you all,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-76">Tell us upon what side the mountain slopes,
So that the going up be possible,
For to lose time irks him most who most knows."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-79">As sheep come issuing forth from out the fold
By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand
Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-82">And what the foremost does the others do,
Huddling themselves against her, if she stop,
Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-85">So moving to approach us thereupon
I saw the leader of that fortunate flock,
Modest in face and dignified in gait.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-88">As soon as those in the advance saw broken
The light upon the ground at my right side,
So that from me the shadow reached the rock,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-91">They stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat;
And all the others, who came after them,
Not knowing why nor wherefore, did the same.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-94">"Without your asking, I confess to you
This is a human body which you see,
Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-97">Marvel ye not thereat, but be persuaded
That not without a power which comes from Heaven
Doth he endeavour to surmount this wall."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-100">The Master thus; and said those worthy people:
"Return ye then, and enter in before us,"
Making a signal with the back o' the hand
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-103">And one of them began: "Whoe'er thou art,
Thus going turn thine eyes, consider well
If e'er thou saw me in the other world."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-106">I turned me tow'rds him, and looked at him closely;
Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect,
But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-109">When with humility I had disclaimed
E'er having seen him, "Now behold!" he said,
And showed me high upon his breast a wound.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-112">Then said he with a smile: "I am Manfredi,
The grandson of the Empress Costanza;
Therefore, when thou returnest, I beseech thee
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-115">Go to my daughter beautiful, the mother
Of Sicily's honour and of Aragon's,
And the truth tell her, if aught else be told.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-118">After I had my body lacerated
By these two mortal stabs, I gave myself
Weeping to Him, who willingly doth pardon.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-121">Horrible my iniquities had been;
But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms,
That it receives whatever turns to it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-124">Had but Cosenza's pastor, who in chase
Of me was sent by Clement at that time,
In God read understandingly this page,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-127">The bones of my dead body still would be
At the bridge-head, near unto Benevento,
Under the safeguard of the heavy cairn.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-130">Now the rain bathes and moveth them the wind,
Beyond the realm, almost beside the Verde,
Where he transported them with tapers quenched.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-133">By malison of theirs is not so lost
Eternal Love, that it cannot return,
So long as hope has anything of green.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-136">True is it, who in contumacy dies
Of Holy Church, though penitent at last,
Must wait upon the outside this bank
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-139">Thirty times told the time that he has been
In his presumption, unless such decree
Shorter by means of righteous prayers become.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-142">See now if thou hast power to make me happy,
By making known unto my good Costanza
How thou hast seen me, and this ban beside,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iii-145">For those on earth can much advance us here."
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto IV

<p id="purgatorio-iv-1">Whenever by delight or else by pain,
That seizes any faculty of ours,
Wholly to that the soul collects itself,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-4">It seemeth that no other power it heeds;
And this against that error is which thinks
One soul above another kindles in us.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-7">And hence, whenever aught is heard or seen
Which keeps the soul intently bent upon it,
Time passes on, and we perceive it not,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-10">Because one faculty is that which listens,
And other that which the soul keeps entire;
This is as if in bonds, and that is free.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-13">Of this I had experience positive
In hearing and in gazing at that spirit;
For fifty full degrees uprisen was
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-16">The sun, and I had not perceived it, when
We came to where those souls with one accord
Cried out unto us: "Here is what you ask."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-19">A greater opening ofttimes hedges up
With but a little forkful of his thorns
The villager, what time the grape imbrowns,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-22">Than was the passage-way through which ascended
Only my Leader and myself behind him,
After that company departed from us.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-25">One climbs Sanleo and descends in Noli,
And mounts the summit of Bismantova,
With feet alone; but here one needs must fly;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-28">With the swift pinions and the plumes I say
Of great desire, conducted after him
Who gave me hope, and made a light for me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-31">We mounted upward through the rifted rock,
And on each side the border pressed upon us,
And feet and hands the ground beneath required.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-34">When we were come upon the upper rim
Of the high bank, out on the open slope,
"My Master," said I, "what way shall we take?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-37">And he to me: "No step of thine descend;
Still up the mount behind me win thy way,
Till some sage escort shall appear to us."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-40">The summit was so high it vanquished sight,
And the hillside precipitous far more
Than line from middle quadrant to the centre.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-43">Spent with fatigue was I, when I began:
"O my sweet Father! turn thee and behold
How I remain alone, unless thou stay!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-46">"O son," he said, "up yonder drag thyself,"
Pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher,
Which on that side encircles all the hill.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-49">These words of his so spurred me on, that I
Strained every nerve, behind him scrambling up,
Until the circle was beneath my feet.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-52">Thereon ourselves we seated both of us
Turned to the East, from which we had ascended,
For all men are delighted to look back.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-55">To the low shores mine eyes I first directed,
Then to the sun uplifted them, and wondered
That on the left hand we were smitten by it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-58">The Poet well perceived that I was wholly
Bewildered at the chariot of the light,
Where 'twixt us and the Aquilon it entered.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-61">Whereon he said to me: "If Castor and Pollux
Were in the company of yonder mirror,
That up and down conducteth with its light,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-64">Thou wouldst behold the zodiac's jagged wheel
Revolving still more near unto the Bears,
Unless it swerved aside from its old track.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-67">How that may be wouldst thou have power to think,
Collected in thyself, imagine Zion
Together with this mount on earth to stand,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-70">So that they both one sole horizon have,
And hemispheres diverse; whereby the road
Which Phaeton, alas! knew not to drive,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-73">Thou'lt see how of necessity must pass
This on one side, when that upon the other,
If thine intelligence right clearly heed."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-76">"Truly, my Master," said I, "never yet
Saw I so clearly as I now discern,
There where my wit appeared incompetent,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-79">That the mid-circle of supernal motion,
Which in some art is the Equator called,
And aye remains between the Sun and Winter,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-82">For reason which thou sayest, departeth hence
Tow'rds the Septentrion, what time the Hebrews
Beheld it tow'rds the region of the heat.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-85">But, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn
How far we have to go; for the hill rises
Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-88">And he to me: "This mount is such, that ever
At the beginning down below 'tis tiresome,
And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-91">Therefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,
That going up shall be to thee as easy
As going down the current in a boat,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-94">Then at this pathway's ending thou wilt be;
There to repose thy panting breath expect;
No more I answer; and this I know for true."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-97">And as he finished uttering these words,
A voice close by us sounded: "Peradventure
Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-100">At sound thereof each one of us turned round,
And saw upon the left hand a great rock,
Which neither I nor he before had noticed.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-103">Thither we drew; and there were persons there
Who in the shadow stood behind the rock,
As one through indolence is wont to stand.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-106">And one of them, who seemed to me fatigued,
Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced,
Holding his face low down between them bowed.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-109">"O my sweet Lord," I said, "do turn thine eye
On him who shows himself more negligent
Then even Sloth herself his sister were."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-112">Then he turned round to us, and he gave heed,
Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh,
And said: "Now go thou up, for thou art valiant."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-115">Then knew I who he was; and the distress,
That still a little did my breathing quicken,
My going to him hindered not; and after
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-118">I came to him he hardly raised his head,
Saying: "Hast thou seen clearly how the sun
O'er thy left shoulder drives his chariot?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-121">His sluggish attitude and his curt words
A little unto laughter moved my lips;
Then I began: "Belacqua, I grieve not
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-124">For thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated
In this place art thou?  Waitest thou an escort?
Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-127">And he: "O brother, what's the use of climbing?
Since to my torment would not let me go
The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-130">First heaven must needs so long revolve me round
Outside thereof, as in my life it did,
Since the good sighs I to the end postponed,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-133">Unless, e'er that, some prayer may bring me aid
Which rises from a heart that lives in grace;
What profit others that in heaven are heard not?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-136">Meanwhile the Poet was before me mounting,
And saying: "Come now; see the sun has touched
Meridian, and from the shore the night
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-iv-139">Covers already with her foot Morocco."
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto V

<p id="purgatorio-v-1">I had already from those shades departed,
And followed in the footsteps of my Guide,
When from behind, pointing his finger at me,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-4">One shouted: "See, it seems as if shone not
The sunshine on the left of him below,
And like one living seems he to conduct him."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-7">Mine eyes I turned at utterance of these words,
And saw them watching with astonishment
But me, but me, and the light which was broken!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-10">"Why doth thy mind so occupy itself,"
The Master said, "that thou thy pace dost slacken?
What matters it to thee what here is whispered?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-13">Come after me, and let the people talk;
Stand like a steadfast tower, that never wags
Its top for all the blowing of the winds;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-16">For evermore the man in whom is springing
Thought upon thought, removes from him the mark,
Because the force of one the other weakens."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-19">What could I say in answer but "I come"?
I said it somewhat with that colour tinged
Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-22">Meanwhile along the mountain-side across
Came people in advance of us a little,
Singing the Miserere verse by verse.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-25">When they became aware I gave no place
For passage of the sunshine through my body,
They changed their song into a long, hoarse "Oh!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-28">And two of them, in form of messengers,
Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us,
"Of your condition make us cognisant."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-31">And said my Master: "Ye can go your way
And carry back again to those who sent you,
That this one's body is of very flesh.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-34">If they stood still because they saw his shadow,
As I suppose, enough is answered them;
Him let them honour, it may profit them."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-37">Vapours enkindled saw I ne'er so swiftly
At early nightfall cleave the air serene,
Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-40">But upward they returned in briefer time,
And, on arriving, with the others wheeled
Tow'rds us, like troops that run without a rein.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-43">"This folk that presses unto us is great,
And cometh to implore thee," said the Poet;
"So still go onward, and in going listen."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-46">"O soul that goest to beatitude
With the same members wherewith thou wast born,"
Shouting they came, "a little stay thy steps,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-49">Look, if thou e'er hast any of us seen,
So that o'er yonder thou bear news of him;
Ah, why dost thou go on?  Ah, why not stay?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-52">Long since we all were slain by violence,
And sinners even to the latest hour;
Then did a light from heaven admonish us,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-55">So that, both penitent and pardoning, forth
From life we issued reconciled to God,
Who with desire to see Him stirs our hearts."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-58">And I: "Although I gaze into your faces,
No one I recognize; but if may please you
Aught I have power to do, ye well-born spirits,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-61">Speak ye, and I will do it, by that peace
Which, following the feet of such a Guide,
From world to world makes itself sought by me."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-64">And one began: "Each one has confidence
In thy good offices without an oath,
Unless the I cannot cut off the I will;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-67">Whence I, who speak alone before the others,
Pray thee, if ever thou dost see the land
That 'twixt Romagna lies and that of Charles,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-70">Thou be so courteous to me of thy prayers
In Fano, that they pray for me devoutly,
That I may purge away my grave offences.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-73">From thence was I; but the deep wounds, through which
Issued the blood wherein I had my seat,
Were dealt me in bosom of the Antenori,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-76">There where I thought to be the most secure;
'Twas he of Este had it done, who held me
In hatred far beyond what justice willed.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-79">But if towards the Mira I had fled,
When I was overtaken at Oriaco,
I still should be o'er yonder where men breathe.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-82">I ran to the lagoon, and reeds and mire
Did so entangle me I fell, and saw there
A lake made from my veins upon the ground."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-85">Then said another: "Ah, be that desire
Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain,
As thou with pious pity aidest mine.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-88">I was of Montefeltro, and am Buonconte;
Giovanna, nor none other cares for me;
Hence among these I go with downcast front."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-91">And I to him: "What violence or what chance
Led thee astray so far from Campaldino,
That never has thy sepulture been known?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-94">"Oh," he replied, "at Casentino's foot
A river crosses named Archiano, born
Above the Hermitage in Apennine.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-97">There where the name thereof becometh void
Did I arrive, pierced through and through the throat,
Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-100">There my sight lost I, and my utterance
Ceased in the name of Mary, and thereat
I fell, and tenantless my flesh remained.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-103">Truth will I speak, repeat it to the living;
God's Angel took me up, and he of hell
Shouted: 'O thou from heaven, why dost thou rob me?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-106">Thou bearest away the eternal part of him,
For one poor little tear, that takes him from me;
But with the rest I'll deal in other fashion!'
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-109">Well knowest thou how in the air is gathered
That humid vapour which to water turns,
Soon as it rises where the cold doth grasp it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-112">He joined that evil will, which aye seeks evil,
To intellect, and moved the mist and wind
By means of power, which his own nature gave;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-115">Thereafter, when the day was spent, the valley
From Pratomagno to the great yoke covered
With fog, and made the heaven above intent,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-118">So that the pregnant air to water changed;
Down fell the rain, and to the gullies came
Whate'er of it earth tolerated not;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-121">And as it mingled with the mighty torrents,
Towards the royal river with such speed
It headlong rushed, that nothing held it back.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-124">My frozen body near unto its outlet
The robust Archian found, and into Arno
Thrust it, and loosened from my breast the cross
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-127">I made of me, when agony o'ercame me;
It rolled me on the banks and on the bottom,
Then with its booty covered and begirt me."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-130">"Ah, when thou hast returned unto the world,
And rested thee from thy long journeying,"
After the second followed the third spirit,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-133">"Do thou remember me who am the Pia;
Siena made me, unmade me Maremma;
He knoweth it, who had encircled first,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-v-136">Espousing me, my finger with his gem."
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto VI

<p id="purgatorio-vi-1">Whene'er is broken up the game of Zara,
He who has lost remains behind despondent,
The throws repeating, and in sadness learns;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-4">The people with the other all depart;
One goes in front, and one behind doth pluck him,
And at his side one brings himself to mind;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-7">He pauses not, and this and that one hears;
They crowd no more to whom his hand he stretches,
And from the throng he thus defends himself.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-10">Even such was I in that dense multitude,
Turning to them this way and that my face,
And, promising, I freed myself therefrom.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-13">There was the Aretine, who from the arms
Untamed of Ghin di Tacco had his death,
And he who fleeing from pursuit was drowned.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-16">There was imploring with his hands outstretched
Frederick Novello, and that one of Pisa
Who made the good Marzucco seem so strong.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-19">I saw Count Orso; and the soul divided
By hatred and by envy from its body,
As it declared, and not for crime committed,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-22">Pierre de la Brosse I say; and here provide
While still on earth the Lady of Brabant,
So that for this she be of no worse flock!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-25">As soon as I was free from all those shades
Who only prayed that some one else may pray,
So as to hasten their becoming holy,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-28">Began I: "It appears that thou deniest,
O light of mine, expressly in some text,
That orison can bend decree of Heaven;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-31">And ne'ertheless these people pray for this.
Might then their expectation bootless be?
Or is to me thy saying not quite clear?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-34">And he to me: "My writing is explicit,
And not fallacious is the hope of these,
If with sane intellect 'tis well regarded;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-37">For top of judgment doth not vail itself,
Because the fire of love fulfils at once
What he must satisfy who here installs him.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-40">And there, where I affirmed that proposition,
Defect was not amended by a prayer,
Because the prayer from God was separate.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-43">Verily, in so deep a questioning
Do not decide, unless she tell it thee,
Who light 'twixt truth and intellect shall be.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-46">I know not if thou understand; I speak
Of Beatrice; her shalt thou see above,
Smiling and happy, on this mountain's top."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-49">And I: "Good Leader, let us make more haste,
For I no longer tire me as before;
And see, e'en now the hill a shadow casts."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-52">"We will go forward with this day" he answered,
"As far as now is possible for us;
But otherwise the fact is than thou thinkest.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-55">Ere thou art up there, thou shalt see return
Him, who now hides himself behind the hill,
So that thou dost not interrupt his rays.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-58">But yonder there behold! a soul that stationed
All, all alone is looking hitherward;
It will point out to us the quickest way."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-61">We came up unto it; O Lombard soul,
How lofty and disdainful thou didst bear thee,
And grand and slow in moving of thine eyes!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-64">Nothing whatever did it say to us,
But let us go our way, eying us only
After the manner of a couchant lion;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-67">Still near to it Virgilius drew, entreating
That it would point us out the best ascent;
And it replied not unto his demand,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-70">But of our native land and of our life
It questioned us; and the sweet Guide began:
"Mantua,"--and the shade, all in itself recluse,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-73">Rose tow'rds him from the place where first it was,
Saying: "O Mantuan, I am Sordello
Of thine own land!" and one embraced the other.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-76">Ah! servile Italy, grief's hostelry!
A ship without a pilot in great tempest!
No Lady thou of Provinces, but brothel!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-79">That noble soul was so impatient, only
At the sweet sound of his own native land,
To make its citizen glad welcome there;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-82">And now within thee are not without war
Thy living ones, and one doth gnaw the other
Of those whom one wall and one fosse shut in!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-85">Search, wretched one, all round about the shores
Thy seaboard, and then look within thy bosom,
If any part of thee enjoyeth peace!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-88">What boots it, that for thee Justinian
The bridle mend, if empty be the saddle?
Withouten this the shame would be the less.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-91">Ah! people, thou that oughtest to be devout,
And to let Caesar sit upon the saddle,
If well thou hearest what God teacheth thee,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-94">Behold how fell this wild beast has become,
Being no longer by the spur corrected,
Since thou hast laid thy hand upon the bridle.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-97">O German Albert! who abandonest
Her that has grown recalcitrant and savage,
And oughtest to bestride her saddle-bow,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-100">May a just judgment from the stars down fall
Upon thy blood, and be it new and open,
That thy successor may have fear thereof;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-103">Because thy father and thyself have suffered,
By greed of those transalpine lands distrained,
The garden of the empire to be waste.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-106">Come and behold Montecchi and Cappelletti,
Monaldi and Fillippeschi, careless man!
Those sad already, and these doubt-depressed!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-109">Come, cruel one! come and behold the oppression
Of thy nobility, and cure their wounds,
And thou shalt see how safe is Santafiore!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-112">Come and behold thy Rome, that is lamenting,
Widowed, alone, and day and night exclaims,
"My Caesar, why hast thou forsaken me?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-115">Come and behold how loving are the people;
And if for us no pity moveth thee,
Come and be made ashamed of thy renown!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-118">And if it lawful be, O Jove Supreme!
Who upon earth for us wast crucified,
Are thy just eyes averted otherwhere?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-121">Or preparation is 't, that, in the abyss
Of thine own counsel, for some good thou makest
From our perception utterly cut off?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-124">For all the towns of Italy are full
Of tyrants, and becometh a Marcellus
Each peasant churl who plays the partisan!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-127">My Florence! well mayst thou contented be
With this digression, which concerns thee not,
Thanks to thy people who such forethought take!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-130">Many at heart have justice, but shoot slowly,
That unadvised they come not to the bow,
But on their very lips thy people have it!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-133">Many refuse to bear the common burden;
But thy solicitous people answereth
Without being asked, and crieth: "I submit."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-136">Now be thou joyful, for thou hast good reason;
Thou affluent, thou in peace, thou full of wisdom!
If I speak true, the event conceals it not.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-139">Athens and Lacedaemon, they who made
The ancient laws, and were so civilized,
Made towards living well a little sign
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-142">Compared with thee, who makest such fine-spun
Provisions, that to middle of November
Reaches not what thou in October spinnest.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-145">How oft, within the time of thy remembrance,
Laws, money, offices, and usages
Hast thou remodelled, and renewed thy members?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-148">And if thou mind thee well, and see the light,
Thou shalt behold thyself like a sick woman,
Who cannot find repose upon her down,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vi-151">But by her tossing wardeth off her pain.
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto VII

<p id="purgatorio-vii-1">After the gracious and glad salutations
Had three and four times been reiterated,
Sordello backward drew and said, "Who are you?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-4">"Or ever to this mountain were directed
The souls deserving to ascend to God,
My bones were buried by Octavian.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-7">I am Virgilius; and for no crime else
Did I lose heaven, than for not having faith;"
In this wise then my Leader made reply.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-10">As one who suddenly before him sees
Something whereat he marvels, who believes
And yet does not, saying, "It is! it is not!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-13">So he appeared; and then bowed down his brow,
And with humility returned towards him,
And, where inferiors embrace, embraced him.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-16">"O glory of the Latians, thou," he said,
"Through whom our language showed what it could do
O pride eternal of the place I came from,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-19">What merit or what grace to me reveals thee?
If I to hear thy words be worthy, tell me
If thou dost come from Hell, and from what cloister."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-22">"Through all the circles of the doleful realm,"
Responded he, "have I come hitherward;
Heaven's power impelled me, and with that I come.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-25">I by not doing, not by doing, lost
The sight of that high sun which thou desirest,
And which too late by me was recognized.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-28">A place there is below not sad with torments,
But darkness only, where the lamentations
Have not the sound of wailing, but are sighs.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-31">There dwell I with the little innocents
Snatched by the teeth of Death, or ever they
Were from our human sinfulness exempt.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-34">There dwell I among those who the three saintly
Virtues did not put on, and without vice
The others knew and followed all of them.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-37">But if thou know and can, some indication
Give us by which we may the sooner come
Where Purgatory has its right beginning."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-40">He answered: "No fixed place has been assigned us;
'Tis lawful for me to go up and round;
So far as I can go, as guide I join thee.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-43">But see already how the day declines,
And to go up by night we are not able;
Therefore 'tis well to think of some fair sojourn.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-46">Souls are there on the right hand here withdrawn;
If thou permit me I will lead thee to them,
And thou shalt know them not without delight."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-49">"How is this?" was the answer; "should one wish
To mount by night would he prevented be
By others? or mayhap would not have power?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-52">And on the ground the good Sordello drew
His finger, saying, "See, this line alone
Thou couldst not pass after the sun is gone;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-55">Not that aught else would hindrance give, however,
To going up, save the nocturnal darkness;
This with the want of power the will perplexes.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-58">We might indeed therewith return below,
And, wandering, walk the hill-side round about,
While the horizon holds the day imprisoned."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-61">Thereon my Lord, as if in wonder, said:
"Do thou conduct us thither, where thou sayest
That we can take delight in tarrying."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-64">Little had we withdrawn us from that place,
When I perceived the mount was hollowed out
In fashion as the valleys here are hollowed.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-67">"Thitherward," said that shade, "will we repair,
Where of itself the hill-side makes a lap,
And there for the new day will we await."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-70">'Twixt hill and plain there was a winding path
Which led us to the margin of that dell,
Where dies the border more than half away.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-73">Gold and fine silver, and scarlet and pearl-white,
The Indian wood resplendent and serene,
Fresh emerald the moment it is broken,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-76">By herbage and by flowers within that hollow
Planted, each one in colour would be vanquished,
As by its greater vanquished is the less.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-79">Nor in that place had nature painted only,
But of the sweetness of a thousand odours
Made there a mingled fragrance and unknown.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-82">"Salve Regina," on the green and flowers
There seated, singing, spirits I beheld,
Which were not visible outside the valley.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-85">"Before the scanty sun now seeks his nest,"
Began the Mantuan who had led us thither,
"Among them do not wish me to conduct you.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-88">Better from off this ledge the acts and faces
Of all of them will you discriminate,
Than in the plain below received among them.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-91">He who sits highest, and the semblance bears
Of having what he should have done neglected,
And to the others' song moves not his lips,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-94">Rudolph the Emperor was, who had the power
To heal the wounds that Italy have slain,
So that through others slowly she revives.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-97">The other, who in look doth comfort him,
Governed the region where the water springs,
The Moldau bears the Elbe, and Elbe the sea.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-100">His name was Ottocar; and in swaddling-clothes
Far better he than bearded Winceslaus
His son, who feeds in luxury and ease.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-103">And the small-nosed, who close in council seems
With him that has an aspect so benign,
Died fleeing and disflowering the lily;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-106">Look there, how he is beating at his breast!
Behold the other one, who for his cheek
Sighing has made of his own palm a bed;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-109">Father and father-in-law of France's Pest
Are they, and know his vicious life and lewd,
And hence proceeds the grief that so doth pierce them.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-112">He who appears so stalwart, and chimes in,
Singing, with that one of the manly nose,
The cord of every valour wore begirt;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-115">And if as King had after him remained
The stripling who in rear of him is sitting,
Well had the valour passed from vase to vase,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-118">Which cannot of the other heirs be said.
Frederick and Jacomo possess the realms,
But none the better heritage possesses.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-121">Not oftentimes upriseth through the branches
The probity of man; and this He wills
Who gives it, so that we may ask of Him.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-124">Eke to the large-nosed reach my words, no less
Than to the other, Pier, who with him sings;
Whence Provence and Apulia grieve already
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-127">The plant is as inferior to its seed,
As more than Beatrice and Margaret
Costanza boasteth of her husband still.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-130">Behold the monarch of the simple life,
Harry of England, sitting there alone;
He in his branches has a better issue.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-133">He who the lowest on the ground among them
Sits looking upward, is the Marquis William,
For whose sake Alessandria and her war
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-vii-136">Make Monferrat and Canavese weep."
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto VIII

<p id="purgatorio-viii-1">'Twas now the hour that turneth back desire
In those who sail the sea, and melts the heart,
The day they've said to their sweet friends farewell,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-4">And the new pilgrim penetrates with love,
If he doth hear from far away a bell
That seemeth to deplore the dying day,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-7">When I began to make of no avail
My hearing, and to watch one of the souls
Uprisen, that begged attention with its hand.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-10">It joined and lifted upward both its palms,
Fixing its eyes upon the orient,
As if it said to God, "Naught else I care for."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-13">"Te lucis ante" so devoutly issued
Forth from its mouth, and with such dulcet notes,
It made me issue forth from my own mind.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-16">And then the others, sweetly and devoutly,
Accompanied it through all the hymn entire,
Having their eyes on the supernal wheels.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-19">Here, Reader, fix thine eyes well on the truth,
For now indeed so subtile is the veil,
Surely to penetrate within is easy.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-22">I saw that army of the gentle-born
Thereafterward in silence upward gaze,
As if in expectation, pale and humble;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-25">And from on high come forth and down descend,
I saw two Angels with two flaming swords,
Truncated and deprived of their points.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-28">Green as the little leaflets just now born
Their garments were, which, by their verdant pinions
Beaten and blown abroad, they trailed behind.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-31">One just above us came to take his station,
And one descended to the opposite bank,
So that the people were contained between them.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-34">Clearly in them discerned I the blond head;
But in their faces was the eye bewildered,
As faculty confounded by excess.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-37">"From Mary's bosom both of them have come,"
Sordello said, "as guardians of the valley
Against the serpent, that will come anon."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-40">Whereupon I, who knew not by what road,
Turned round about, and closely drew myself,
Utterly frozen, to the faithful shoulders.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-43">And once again Sordello: "Now descend we
'Mid the grand shades, and we will speak to them;
Right pleasant will it be for them to see you."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-46">Only three steps I think that I descended,
And was below, and saw one who was looking
Only at me, as if he fain would know me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-49">Already now the air was growing dark,
But not so that between his eyes and mine
It did not show what it before locked up.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-52">Tow'rds me he moved, and I tow'rds him did move;
Noble Judge Nino! how it me delighted,
When I beheld thee not among the damned!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-55">No greeting fair was left unsaid between us;
Then asked he: "How long is it since thou camest
O'er the far waters to the mountain's foot?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-58">"Oh!" said I to him, "through the dismal places
I came this morn; and am in the first life,
Albeit the other, going thus, I gain."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-61">And on the instant my reply was heard,
He and Sordello both shrank back from me,
Like people who are suddenly bewildered.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-64">One to Virgilius, and the other turned
To one who sat there, crying, "Up, Currado!
Come and behold what God in grace has willed!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-67">Then, turned to me: "By that especial grace
Thou owest unto Him, who so conceals
His own first wherefore, that it has no ford,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-70">When thou shalt be beyond the waters wide,
Tell my Giovanna that she pray for me,
Where answer to the innocent is made.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-73">I do not think her mother loves me more,
Since she has laid aside her wimple white,
Which she, unhappy, needs must wish again.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-76">Through her full easily is comprehended
How long in woman lasts the fire of love,
If eye or touch do not relight it often.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-79">So fair a hatchment will not make for her
The Viper marshalling the Milanese
A-field, as would have made Gallura's Cock."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-82">In this wise spake he, with the stamp impressed
Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal
Which measurably burneth in the heart.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-85">My greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven,
Still to that point where slowest are the stars,
Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-88">And my Conductor: "Son, what dost thou gaze at
Up there?"  And I to him: "At those three torches
With which this hither pole is all on fire."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-91">And he to me: "The four resplendent stars
Thou sawest this morning are down yonder low,
And these have mounted up to where those were."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-94">As he was speaking, to himself Sordello
Drew him, and said, "Lo there our Adversary!"
And pointed with his finger to look thither.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-97">Upon the side on which the little valley
No barrier hath, a serpent was; perchance
The same which gave to Eve the bitter food.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-100">'Twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak,
Turning at times its head about, and licking
Its back like to a beast that smoothes itself.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-103">I did not see, and therefore cannot say
How the celestial falcons 'gan to move,
But well I saw that they were both in motion.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-106">Hearing the air cleft by their verdant wings,
The serpent fled, and round the Angels wheeled,
Up to their stations flying back alike.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-109">The shade that to the Judge had near approached
When he had called, throughout that whole assault
Had not a moment loosed its gaze on me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-112">"So may the light that leadeth thee on high
Find in thine own free-will as much of wax
As needful is up to the highest azure,"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-115">Began it, "if some true intelligence
Of Valdimagra or its neighbourhood
Thou knowest, tell it me, who once was great there.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-118">Currado Malaspina was I called;
I'm not the elder, but from him descended;
To mine I bore the love which here refineth."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-121">"O," said I unto him, "through your domains
I never passed, but where is there a dwelling
Throughout all Europe, where they are not known?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-124">That fame, which doeth honour to your house,
Proclaims its Signors and proclaims its land,
So that he knows of them who ne'er was there.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-127">And, as I hope for heaven, I swear to you
Your honoured family in naught abates
The glory of the purse and of the sword.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-130">It is so privileged by use and nature,
That though a guilty head misguide the world,
Sole it goes right, and scorns the evil way."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-133">And he: "Now go; for the sun shall not lie
Seven times upon the pillow which the Ram
With all his four feet covers and bestrides,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-136">Before that such a courteous opinion
Shall in the middle of thy head be nailed
With greater nails than of another's speech,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-viii-139">Unless the course of justice standeth still."
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto IX

<p id="purgatorio-ix-1">The concubine of old Tithonus now
Gleamed white upon the eastern balcony,
Forth from the arms of her sweet paramour;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-4">With gems her forehead all relucent was,
Set in the shape of that cold animal
Which with its tail doth smite amain the nations,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-7">And of the steps, with which she mounts, the Night
Had taken two in that place where we were,
And now the third was bending down its wings;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-10">When I, who something had of Adam in me,
Vanquished by sleep, upon the grass reclined,
There were all five of us already sat.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-13">Just at the hour when her sad lay begins
The little swallow, near unto the morning,
Perchance in memory of her former woes,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-16">And when the mind of man, a wanderer
More from the flesh, and less by thought imprisoned,
Almost prophetic in its visions is,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-19">In dreams it seemed to me I saw suspended
An eagle in the sky, with plumes of gold,
With wings wide open, and intent to stoop,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-22">And this, it seemed to me, was where had been
By Ganymede his kith and kin abandoned,
When to the high consistory he was rapt.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-25">I thought within myself, perchance he strikes
From habit only here, and from elsewhere
Disdains to bear up any in his feet.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-28">Then wheeling somewhat more, it seemed to me,
Terrible as the lightning he descended,
And snatched me upward even to the fire.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-31">Therein it seemed that he and I were burning,
And the imagined fire did scorch me so,
That of necessity my sleep was broken.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-34">Not otherwise Achilles started up,
Around him turning his awakened eyes,
And knowing not the place in which he was,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-37">What time from Chiron stealthily his mother
Carried him sleeping in her arms to Scyros,
Wherefrom the Greeks withdrew him afterwards,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-40">Than I upstarted, when from off my face
Sleep fled away; and pallid I became,
As doth the man who freezes with affright.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-43">Only my Comforter was at my side,
And now the sun was more than two hours high,
And turned towards the sea-shore was my face.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-46">"Be not intimidated," said my Lord,
"Be reassured, for all is well with us;
Do not restrain, but put forth all thy strength.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-49">Thou hast at length arrived at Purgatory;
See there the cliff that closes it around;
See there the entrance, where it seems disjoined.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-52">Whilom at dawn, which doth precede the day,
When inwardly thy spirit was asleep
Upon the flowers that deck the land below,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-55">There came a Lady and said: 'I am Lucia;
Let me take this one up, who is asleep;
So will I make his journey easier for him.'
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-58">Sordello and the other noble shapes
Remained; she took thee, and, as day grew bright,
Upward she came, and I upon her footsteps.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-61">She laid thee here; and first her beauteous eyes
That open entrance pointed out to me;
Then she and sleep together went away."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-64">In guise of one whose doubts are reassured,
And who to confidence his fear doth change,
After the truth has been discovered to him,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-67">So did I change; and when without disquiet
My Leader saw me, up along the cliff
He moved, and I behind him, tow'rd the height.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-70">Reader, thou seest well how I exalt
My theme, and therefore if with greater art
I fortify it, marvel not thereat.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-73">Nearer approached we, and were in such place,
That there, where first appeared to me a rift
Like to a crevice that disparts a wall,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-76">I saw a portal, and three stairs beneath,
Diverse in colour, to go up to it,
And a gate-keeper, who yet spake no word.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-79">And as I opened more and more mine eyes,
I saw him seated on the highest stair,
Such in the face that I endured it not.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-82">And in his hand he had a naked sword,
Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow'rds us,
That oft in vain I lifted up mine eyes.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-85">"Tell it from where you are, what is't you wish?"
Began he to exclaim; "where is the escort?
Take heed your coming hither harm you not!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-88">"A Lady of Heaven, with these things conversant,"
My Master answered him, "but even now
Said to us, 'Thither go; there is the portal.'"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-91">"And may she speed your footsteps in all good,"
Again began the courteous janitor;
"Come forward then unto these stairs of ours."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-94">Thither did we approach; and the first stair
Was marble white, so polished and so smooth,
I mirrored myself therein as I appear.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-97">The second, tinct of deeper hue than perse,
Was of a calcined and uneven stone,
Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-100">The third, that uppermost rests massively,
Porphyry seemed to me, as flaming red
As blood that from a vein is spirting forth.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-103">Both of his feet was holding upon this
The Angel of God, upon the threshold seated,
Which seemed to me a stone of diamond.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-106">Along the three stairs upward with good will
Did my Conductor draw me, saying: "Ask
Humbly that he the fastening may undo."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-109">Devoutly at the holy feet I cast me,
For mercy's sake besought that he would open,
But first upon my breast three times I smote.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-112">Seven P's upon my forehead he described
With the sword's point, and, "Take heed that thou wash
These wounds, when thou shalt be within," he said.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-115">Ashes, or earth that dry is excavated,
Of the same colour were with his attire,
And from beneath it he drew forth two keys.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-118">One was of gold, and the other was of silver;
First with the white, and after with the yellow,
Plied he the door, so that I was content.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-121">"Whenever faileth either of these keys
So that it turn not rightly in the lock,"
He said to us, "this entrance doth not open.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-124">More precious one is, but the other needs
More art and intellect ere it unlock,
For it is that which doth the knot unloose.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-127">From Peter I have them; and he bade me err
Rather in opening than in keeping shut,
If people but fall down before my feet."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-130">Then pushed the portals of the sacred door,
Exclaiming: "Enter; but I give you warning
That forth returns whoever looks behind."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-133">And when upon their hinges were turned round
The swivels of that consecrated gate,
Which are of metal, massive and sonorous,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-136">Roared not so loud, nor so discordant seemed
Tarpeia, when was ta'en from it the good
Metellus, wherefore meagre it remained.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-139">At the first thunder-peal I turned attentive,
And "Te Deum laudamus" seemed to hear
In voices mingled with sweet melody.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-142">Exactly such an image rendered me
That which I heard, as we are wont to catch,
When people singing with the organ stand;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-ix-145">For now we hear, and now hear not, the words.
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto X

<p id="purgatorio-x-1">When we had crossed the threshold of the door
Which the perverted love of souls disuses,
Because it makes the crooked way seem straight,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-4">Re-echoing I heard it closed again;
And if I had turned back mine eyes upon it,
What for my failing had been fit excuse?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-7">We mounted upward through a rifted rock,
Which undulated to this side and that,
Even as a wave receding and advancing.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-10">"Here it behoves us use a little art,"
Began my Leader, "to adapt ourselves
Now here, now there, to the receding side."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-13">And this our footsteps so infrequent made,
That sooner had the moon's decreasing disk
Regained its bed to sink again to rest,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-16">Than we were forth from out that needle's eye;
But when we free and in the open were,
There where the mountain backward piles itself,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-19">I wearied out, and both of us uncertain
About our way, we stopped upon a plain
More desolate than roads across the deserts.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-22">From where its margin borders on the void,
To foot of the high bank that ever rises,
A human body three times told would measure;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-25">And far as eye of mine could wing its flight,
Now on the left, and on the right flank now,
The same this cornice did appear to me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-28">Thereon our feet had not been moved as yet,
When I perceived the embankment round about,
Which all right of ascent had interdicted,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-31">To be of marble white, and so adorned
With sculptures, that not only Polycletus,
But Nature's self, had there been put to shame.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-34">The Angel, who came down to earth with tidings
Of peace, that had been wept for many a year,
And opened Heaven from its long interdict,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-37">In front of us appeared so truthfully
There sculptured in a gracious attitude,
He did not seem an image that is silent.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-40">One would have sworn that he was saying, "Ave;"
For she was there in effigy portrayed
Who turned the key to ope the exalted love,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-43">And in her mien this language had impressed,
"Ecce ancilla Dei," as distinctly
As any figure stamps itself in wax.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-46">"Keep not thy mind upon one place alone,"
The gentle Master said, who had me standing
Upon that side where people have their hearts;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-49">Whereat I moved mine eyes, and I beheld
In rear of Mary, and upon that side
Where he was standing who conducted me,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-52">Another story on the rock imposed;
Wherefore I passed Virgilius and drew near,
So that before mine eyes it might be set.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-55">There sculptured in the self-same marble were
The cart and oxen, drawing the holy ark,
Wherefore one dreads an office not appointed.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-58">People appeared in front, and all of them
In seven choirs divided, of two senses
Made one say "No," the other, "Yes, they sing."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-61">Likewise unto the smoke of the frankincense,
Which there was imaged forth, the eyes and nose
Were in the yes and no discordant made.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-64">Preceded there the vessel benedight,
Dancing with girded loins, the humble Psalmist,
And more and less than King was he in this.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-67">Opposite, represented at the window
Of a great palace, Michal looked upon him,
Even as a woman scornful and afflicted.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-70">I moved my feet from where I had been standing,
To examine near at hand another story,
Which after Michal glimmered white upon me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-73">There the high glory of the Roman Prince
Was chronicled, whose great beneficence
Moved Gregory to his great victory;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-76">'Tis of the Emperor Trajan I am speaking;
And a poor widow at his bridle stood,
In attitude of weeping and of grief.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-79">Around about him seemed it thronged and full
Of cavaliers, and the eagles in the gold
Above them visibly in the wind were moving.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-82">The wretched woman in the midst of these
Seemed to be saying: "Give me vengeance, Lord,
For my dead son, for whom my heart is breaking."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-85">And he to answer her: "Now wait until
I shall return."  And she: "My Lord," like one
In whom grief is impatient, "shouldst thou not
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-88">Return?"  And he: "Who shall be where I am
Will give it thee."  And she: "Good deed of others
What boots it thee, if thou neglect thine own?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-91">Whence he: "Now comfort thee, for it behoves me
That I discharge my duty ere I move;
Justice so wills, and pity doth retain me."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-94">He who on no new thing has ever looked
Was the creator of this visible language,
Novel to us, for here it is not found.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-97">While I delighted me in contemplating
The images of such humility,
And dear to look on for their Maker's sake,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-100">"Behold, upon this side, but rare they make
Their steps," the Poet murmured, "many people;
These will direct us to the lofty stairs."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-103">Mine eyes, that in beholding were intent
To see new things, of which they curious are,
In turning round towards him were not slow.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-106">But still I wish not, Reader, thou shouldst swerve
From thy good purposes, because thou hearest
How God ordaineth that the debt be paid;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-109">Attend not to the fashion of the torment,
Think of what follows; think that at the worst
It cannot reach beyond the mighty sentence.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-112">"Master," began I, "that which I behold
Moving towards us seems to me not persons,
And what I know not, so in sight I waver."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-115">And he to me: "The grievous quality
Of this their torment bows them so to earth,
That my own eyes at first contended with it;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-118">But look there fixedly, and disentangle
By sight what cometh underneath those stones;
Already canst thou see how each is stricken."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-121">O ye proud Christians! wretched, weary ones!
Who, in the vision of the mind infirm
Confidence have in your backsliding steps,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-124">Do ye not comprehend that we are worms,
Born to bring forth the angelic butterfly
That flieth unto judgment without screen?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-127">Why floats aloft your spirit high in air?
Like are ye unto insects undeveloped,
Even as the worm in whom formation fails!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-130">As to sustain a ceiling or a roof,
In place of corbel, oftentimes a figure
Is seen to join its knees unto its breast,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-133">Which makes of the unreal real anguish
Arise in him who sees it, fashioned thus
Beheld I those, when I had ta'en good heed.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-136">True is it, they were more or less bent down,
According as they more or less were laden;
And he who had most patience in his looks
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-x-139">Weeping did seem to say, "I can no more!"
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XI

<p id="purgatorio-xi-1">"Our Father, thou who dwellest in the heavens,
Not circumscribed, but from the greater love
Thou bearest to the first effects on high,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-4">Praised be thy name and thine omnipotence
By every creature, as befitting is
To render thanks to thy sweet effluence.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-7">Come unto us the peace of thy dominion,
For unto it we cannot of ourselves,
If it come not, with all our intellect.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-10">Even as thine own Angels of their will
Make sacrifice to thee, Hosanna singing,
So may all men make sacrifice of theirs.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-13">Give unto us this day our daily manna,
Withouten which in this rough wilderness
Backward goes he who toils most to advance.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-16">And even as we the trespass we have suffered
Pardon in one another, pardon thou
Benignly, and regard not our desert.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-19">Our virtue, which is easily o'ercome,
Put not to proof with the old Adversary,
But thou from him who spurs it so, deliver.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-22">This last petition verily, dear Lord,
Not for ourselves is made, who need it not,
But for their sake who have remained behind us."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-25">Thus for themselves and us good furtherance
Those shades imploring, went beneath a weight
Like unto that of which we sometimes dream,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-28">Unequally in anguish round and round
And weary all, upon that foremost cornice,
Purging away the smoke-stains of the world.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-31">If there good words are always said for us,
What may not here be said and done for them,
By those who have a good root to their will?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-34">Well may we help them wash away the marks
That hence they carried, so that clean and light
They may ascend unto the starry wheels!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-37">"Ah! so may pity and justice you disburden
Soon, that ye may have power to move the wing,
That shall uplift you after your desire,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-40">Show us on which hand tow'rd the stairs the way
Is shortest, and if more than one the passes,
Point us out that which least abruptly falls;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-43">For he who cometh with me, through the burden
Of Adam's flesh wherewith he is invested,
Against his will is chary of his climbing."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-46">The words of theirs which they returned to those
That he whom I was following had spoken,
It was not manifest from whom they came,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-49">But it was said: "To the right hand come with us
Along the bank, and ye shall find a pass
Possible for living person to ascend.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-52">And were I not impeded by the stone,
Which this proud neck of mine doth subjugate,
Whence I am forced to hold my visage down,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-55">Him, who still lives and does not name himself,
Would I regard, to see if I may know him
And make him piteous unto this burden.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-58">A Latian was I, and born of a great Tuscan;
Guglielmo Aldobrandeschi was my father;
I know not if his name were ever with you.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-61">The ancient blood and deeds of gallantry
Of my progenitors so arrogant made me
That, thinking not upon the common mother,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-64">All men I held in scorn to such extent
I died therefor, as know the Sienese,
And every child in Campagnatico.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-67">I am Omberto; and not to me alone
Has pride done harm, but all my kith and kin
Has with it dragged into adversity.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-70">And here must I this burden bear for it
Till God be satisfied, since I did not
Among the living, here among the dead."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-73">Listening I downward bent my countenance;
And one of them, not this one who was speaking,
Twisted himself beneath the weight that cramps him,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-76">And looked at me, and knew me, and called out,
Keeping his eyes laboriously fixed
On me, who all bowed down was going with them.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-79">"O," asked I him, "art thou not Oderisi,
Agobbio's honour, and honour of that art
Which is in Paris called illuminating?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-82">"Brother," said he, "more laughing are the leaves
Touched by the brush of Franco Bolognese;
All his the honour now, and mine in part.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-85">In sooth I had not been so courteous
While I was living, for the great desire
Of excellence, on which my heart was bent.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-88">Here of such pride is paid the forfeiture;
And yet I should not be here, were it not
That, having power to sin, I turned to God.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-91">O thou vain glory of the human powers,
How little green upon thy summit lingers,
If't be not followed by an age of grossness!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-94">In painting Cimabue thought that he
Should hold the field, now Giotto has the cry,
So that the other's fame is growing dim.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-97">So has one Guido from the other taken
The glory of our tongue, and he perchance
Is born, who from the nest shall chase them both.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-100">Naught is this mundane rumour but a breath
Of wind, that comes now this way and now that,
And changes name, because it changes side.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-103">What fame shalt thou have more, if old peel off
From thee thy flesh, than if thou hadst been dead
Before thou left the 'pappo' and the 'dindi,'
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-106">Ere pass a thousand years? which is a shorter
Space to the eterne, than twinkling of an eye
Unto the circle that in heaven wheels slowest.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-109">With him, who takes so little of the road
In front of me, all Tuscany resounded;
And now he scarce is lisped of in Siena,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-112">Where he was lord, what time was overthrown
The Florentine delirium, that superb
Was at that day as now 'tis prostitute.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-115">Your reputation is the colour of grass
Which comes and goes, and that discolours it
By which it issues green from out the earth."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-118">And I: "Thy true speech fills my heart with good
Humility, and great tumour thou assuagest;
But who is he, of whom just now thou spakest?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-121">"That," he replied, "is Provenzan Salvani,
And he is here because he had presumed
To bring Siena all into his hands.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-124">He has gone thus, and goeth without rest
E'er since he died; such money renders back
In payment he who is on earth too daring."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-127">And I: "If every spirit who awaits
The verge of life before that he repent,
Remains below there and ascends not hither,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-130">(Unless good orison shall him bestead,)
Until as much time as he lived be passed,
How was the coming granted him in largess?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-133">"When he in greatest splendour lived," said he,
"Freely upon the Campo of Siena,
All shame being laid aside, he placed himself;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-136">And there to draw his friend from the duress
Which in the prison-house of Charles he suffered,
He brought himself to tremble in each vein.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-139">I say no more, and know that I speak darkly;
Yet little time shall pass before thy neighbours
Will so demean themselves that thou canst gloss it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xi-142">This action has released him from those confines."
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XII

<p id="purgatorio-xii-1">Abreast, like oxen going in a yoke,
I with that heavy-laden soul went on,
As long as the sweet pedagogue permitted;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-4">But when he said, "Leave him, and onward pass,
For here 'tis good that with the sail and oars,
As much as may be, each push on his barque;"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-7">Upright, as walking wills it, I redressed
My person, notwithstanding that my thoughts
Remained within me downcast and abashed.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-10">I had moved on, and followed willingly
The footsteps of my Master, and we both
Already showed how light of foot we were,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-13">When unto me he said: "Cast down thine eyes;
'Twere well for thee, to alleviate the way,
To look upon the bed beneath thy feet."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-16">As, that some memory may exist of them,
Above the buried dead their tombs in earth
Bear sculptured on them what they were before;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-19">Whence often there we weep for them afresh,
From pricking of remembrance, which alone
To the compassionate doth set its spur;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-22">So saw I there, but of a better semblance
In point of artifice, with figures covered
Whate'er as pathway from the mount projects.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-25">I saw that one who was created noble
More than all other creatures, down from heaven
Flaming with lightnings fall upon one side.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-28">I saw Briareus smitten by the dart
Celestial, lying on the other side,
Heavy upon the earth by mortal frost.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-31">I saw Thymbraeus, Pallas saw, and Mars,
Still clad in armour round about their father,
Gaze at the scattered members of the giants.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-34">I saw, at foot of his great labour, Nimrod,
As if bewildered, looking at the people
Who had been proud with him in Sennaar.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-37">O Niobe! with what afflicted eyes
Thee I beheld upon the pathway traced,
Between thy seven and seven children slain!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-40">O Saul! how fallen upon thy proper sword
Didst thou appear there lifeless in Gilboa,
That felt thereafter neither rain nor dew!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-43">O mad Arachne! so I thee beheld
E'en then half spider, sad upon the shreds
Of fabric wrought in evil hour for thee!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-46">O Rehoboam! no more seems to threaten
Thine image there; but full of consternation
A chariot bears it off, when none pursues!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-49">Displayed moreo'er the adamantine pavement
How unto his own mother made Alcmaeon
Costly appear the luckless ornament;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-52">Displayed how his own sons did throw themselves
Upon Sennacherib within the temple,
And how, he being dead, they left him there;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-55">Displayed the ruin and the cruel carnage
That Tomyris wrought, when she to Cyrus said,
"Blood didst thou thirst for, and with blood I glut thee!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-58">Displayed how routed fled the Assyrians
After that Holofernes had been slain,
And likewise the remainder of that slaughter.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-61">I saw there Troy in ashes and in caverns;
O Ilion! thee, how abject and debased,
Displayed the image that is there discerned!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-64">Whoe'er of pencil master was or stile,
That could portray the shades and traits which there
Would cause each subtile genius to admire?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-67">Dead seemed the dead, the living seemed alive;
Better than I saw not who saw the truth,
All that I trod upon while bowed I went.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-70">Now wax ye proud, and on with looks uplifted,
Ye sons of Eve, and bow not down your faces
So that ye may behold your evil ways!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-73">More of the mount by us was now encompassed,
And far more spent the circuit of the sun,
Than had the mind preoccupied imagined,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-76">When he, who ever watchful in advance
Was going on, began: "Lift up thy head,
'Tis no more time to go thus meditating.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-79">Lo there an Angel who is making haste
To come towards us; lo, returning is
From service of the day the sixth handmaiden.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-82">With reverence thine acts and looks adorn,
So that he may delight to speed us upward;
Think that this day will never dawn again."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-85">I was familiar with his admonition
Ever to lose no time; so on this theme
He could not unto me speak covertly.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-88">Towards us came the being beautiful
Vested in white, and in his countenance
Such as appears the tremulous morning star.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-91">His arms he opened, and opened then his wings;
"Come," said he, "near at hand here are the steps,
And easy from henceforth is the ascent."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-94">At this announcement few are they who come!
O human creatures, born to soar aloft,
Why fall ye thus before a little wind?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-97">He led us on to where the rock was cleft;
There smote upon my forehead with his wings,
Then a safe passage promised unto me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-100">As on the right hand, to ascend the mount
Where seated is the church that lordeth it
O'er the well-guided, above Rubaconte,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-103">The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken
By stairways that were made there in the age
When still were safe the ledger and the stave,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-106">E'en thus attempered is the bank which falls
Sheer downward from the second circle there;
But on this, side and that the high rock graze.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-109">As we were turning thitherward our persons,
"Beati pauperes spiritu," voices
Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-112">Ah me! how different are these entrances
From the Infernal! for with anthems here
One enters, and below with wild laments.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-115">We now were hunting up the sacred stairs,
And it appeared to me by far more easy
Than on the plain it had appeared before.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-118">Whence I: "My Master, say, what heavy thing
Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly
Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-121">He answered: "When the P's which have remained
Still on thy face almost obliterate
Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-124">Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will,
That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,
But urging up will be to them delight."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-127">Then did I even as they do who are going
With something on the head to them unknown,
Unless the signs of others make them doubt,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-130">Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,
And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office
Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-133">And with the fingers of the right hand spread
I found but six the letters, that had carved
Upon my temples he who bore the keys;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xii-136">Upon beholding which my Leader smiled.
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XIII

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-1">We were upon the summit of the stairs,
Where for the second time is cut away
The mountain, which ascending shriveth all.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-4">There in like manner doth a cornice bind
The hill all round about, as does the first,
Save that its arc more suddenly is curved.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-7">Shade is there none, nor sculpture that appears;
So seems the bank, and so the road seems smooth,
With but the livid colour of the stone.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-10">"If to inquire we wait for people here,"
The Poet said, "I fear that peradventure
Too much delay will our election have."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-13">Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed,
Made his right side the centre of his motion,
And turned the left part of himself about.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-16">"O thou sweet light! with trust in whom I enter
Upon this novel journey, do thou lead us,"
Said he, "as one within here should be led.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-19">Thou warmest the world, thou shinest over it;
If other reason prompt not otherwise,
Thy rays should evermore our leaders be!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-22">As much as here is counted for a mile,
So much already there had we advanced
In little time, by dint of ready will;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-25">And tow'rds us there were heard to fly, albeit
They were not visible, spirits uttering
Unto Love's table courteous invitations,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-28">The first voice that passed onward in its flight,
"Vinum non habent," said in accents loud,
And went reiterating it behind us.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-31">And ere it wholly grew inaudible
Because of distance, passed another, crying,
"I am Orestes!" and it also stayed not.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-34">"O," said I, "Father, these, what voices are they?"
And even as I asked, behold the third,
Saying: "Love those from whom ye have had evil!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-37">And the good Master said: "This circle scourges
The sin of envy, and on that account
Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-40">The bridle of another sound shall be;
I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge,
Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-43">But fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast,
And people thou wilt see before us sitting,
And each one close against the cliff is seated."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-46">Then wider than at first mine eyes I opened;
I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles
Not from the colour of the stone diverse.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-49">And when we were a little farther onward,
I heard a cry of, "Mary, pray for us!"
A cry of, "Michael, Peter, and all Saints!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-52">I do not think there walketh still on earth
A man so hard, that he would not be pierced
With pity at what afterward I saw.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-55">For when I had approached so near to them
That manifest to me their acts became,
Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-58">Covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me,
And one sustained the other with his shoulder,
And all of them were by the bank sustained.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-61">Thus do the blind, in want of livelihood,
Stand at the doors of churches asking alms,
And one upon another leans his head,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-64">So that in others pity soon may rise,
Not only at the accent of their words,
But at their aspect, which no less implores.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-67">And as unto the blind the sun comes not,
So to the shades, of whom just now I spake,
Heaven's light will not be bounteous of itself;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-70">For all their lids an iron wire transpierces,
And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild
Is done, because it will not quiet stay.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-73">To me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage,
Seeing the others without being seen;
Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-76">Well knew he what the mute one wished to say,
And therefore waited not for my demand,
But said: "Speak, and be brief, and to the point."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-79">I had Virgilius upon that side
Of the embankment from which one may fall,
Since by no border 'tis engarlanded;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-82">Upon the other side of me I had
The shades devout, who through the horrible seam
Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-85">To them I turned me, and, "O people, certain,"
Began I, "of beholding the high light,
Which your desire has solely in its care,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-88">So may grace speedily dissolve the scum
Upon your consciences, that limpidly
Through them descend the river of the mind,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-91">Tell me, for dear 'twill be to me and gracious,
If any soul among you here is Latian,
And 'twill perchance be good for him I learn it."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-94">"O brother mine, each one is citizen
Of one true city; but thy meaning is,
Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-97">By way of answer this I seemed to hear
A little farther on than where I stood,
Whereat I made myself still nearer heard.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-100">Among the rest I saw a shade that waited
In aspect, and should any one ask how,
Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-103">"Spirit," I said, "who stoopest to ascend,
If thou art he who did reply to me,
Make thyself known to me by place or name."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-106">"Sienese was I," it replied, "and with
The others here recleanse my guilty life,
Weeping to Him to lend himself to us.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-109">Sapient I was not, although I Sapia
Was called, and I was at another's harm
More happy far than at my own good fortune.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-112">And that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee,
Hear if I was as foolish as I tell thee.
The arc already of my years descending,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-115">My fellow-citizens near unto Colle
Were joined in battle with their adversaries,
And I was praying God for what he willed.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-118">Routed were they, and turned into the bitter
Passes of flight; and I, the chase beholding,
A joy received unequalled by all others;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-121">So that I lifted upward my bold face
Crying to God, 'Henceforth I fear thee not,'
As did the blackbird at the little sunshine.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-124">Peace I desired with God at the extreme
Of my existence, and as yet would not
My debt have been by penitence discharged,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-127">Had it not been that in remembrance held me
Pier Pettignano in his holy prayers,
Who out of charity was grieved for me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-130">But who art thou, that into our conditions
Questioning goest, and hast thine eyes unbound
As I believe, and breathing dost discourse?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-133">"Mine eyes," I said, "will yet be here ta'en from me,
But for short space; for small is the offence
Committed by their being turned with envy.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-136">Far greater is the fear, wherein suspended
My soul is, of the torment underneath,
For even now the load down there weighs on me."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-139">And she to me: "Who led thee, then, among us
Up here, if to return below thou thinkest?"
And I: "He who is with me, and speaks not;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-142">And living am I; therefore ask of me,
Spirit elect, if thou wouldst have me move
O'er yonder yet my mortal feet for thee."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-145">"O, this is such a novel thing to hear,"
She answered, "that great sign it is God loves thee;
Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-148">And I implore, by what thou most desirest,
If e'er thou treadest the soil of Tuscany,
Well with my kindred reinstate my fame.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-151">Them wilt thou see among that people vain
Who hope in Talamone, and will lose there
More hope than in discovering the Diana;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiii-154">But there still more the admirals will lose."
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XIV

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-1">"Who is this one that goes about our mountain,
Or ever Death has given him power of flight,
And opes his eyes and shuts them at his will?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-4">"I know not who, but know he's not alone;
Ask him thyself, for thou art nearer to him,
And gently, so that he may speak, accost him."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-7">Thus did two spirits, leaning tow'rds each other,
Discourse about me there on the right hand;
Then held supine their faces to address me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-10">And said the one: "O soul, that, fastened still
Within the body, tow'rds the heaven art going,
For charity console us, and declare
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-13">Whence comest and who art thou; for thou mak'st us
As much to marvel at this grace of thine
As must a thing that never yet has been."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-16">And I: "Through midst of Tuscany there wanders
A streamlet that is born in Falterona,
And not a hundred miles of course suffice it;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-19">From thereupon do I this body bring.
To tell you who I am were speech in vain,
Because my name as yet makes no great noise."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-22">"If well thy meaning I can penetrate
With intellect of mine," then answered me
He who first spake, "thou speakest of the Arno."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-25">And said the other to him: "Why concealed
This one the appellation of that river,
Even as a man doth of things horrible?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-28">And thus the shade that questioned was of this
Himself acquitted: "I know not; but truly
'Tis fit the name of such a valley perish;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-31">For from its fountain-head (where is so pregnant
The Alpine mountain whence is cleft Peloro
That in few places it that mark surpasses)
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-34">To where it yields itself in restoration
Of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up,
Whence have the rivers that which goes with them,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-37">Virtue is like an enemy avoided
By all, as is a serpent, through misfortune
Of place, or through bad habit that impels them;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-40">On which account have so transformed their nature
The dwellers in that miserable valley,
It seems that Circe had them in her pasture.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-43">'Mid ugly swine, of acorns worthier
Than other food for human use created,
It first directeth its impoverished way.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-46">Curs findeth it thereafter, coming downward,
More snarling than their puissance demands,
And turns from them disdainfully its muzzle.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-49">It goes on falling, and the more it grows,
The more it finds the dogs becoming wolves,
This maledict and misadventurous ditch.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-52">Descended then through many a hollow gulf,
It finds the foxes so replete with fraud,
They fear no cunning that may master them.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-55">Nor will I cease because another hears me;
And well 'twill be for him, if still he mind him
Of what a truthful spirit to me unravels.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-58">Thy grandson I behold, who doth become
A hunter of those wolves upon the bank
Of the wild stream, and terrifies them all.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-61">He sells their flesh, it being yet alive;
Thereafter slaughters them like ancient beeves;
Many of life, himself of praise, deprives.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-64">Blood-stained he issues from the dismal forest;
He leaves it such, a thousand years from now
In its primeval state 'tis not re-wooded."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-67">As at the announcement of impending ills
The face of him who listens is disturbed,
From whate'er side the peril seize upon him;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-70">So I beheld that other soul, which stood
Turned round to listen, grow disturbed and sad,
When it had gathered to itself the word.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-73">The speech of one and aspect of the other
Had me desirous made to know their names,
And question mixed with prayers I made thereof,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-76">Whereat the spirit which first spake to me
Began again: "Thou wishest I should bring me
To do for thee what thou'lt not do for me;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-79">But since God willeth that in thee shine forth
Such grace of his, I'll not be chary with thee;
Know, then, that I Guido del Duca am.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-82">My blood was so with envy set on fire,
That if I had beheld a man make merry,
Thou wouldst have seen me sprinkled o'er with pallor.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-85">From my own sowing such the straw I reap!
O human race! why dost thou set thy heart
Where interdict of partnership must be?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-88">This is Renier; this is the boast and honour
Of the house of Calboli, where no one since
Has made himself the heir of his desert.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-91">And not alone his blood is made devoid,
'Twixt Po and mount, and sea-shore and the Reno,
Of good required for truth and for diversion;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-94">For all within these boundaries is full
Of venomous roots, so that too tardily
By cultivation now would they diminish.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-97">Where is good Lizio, and Arrigo Manardi,
Pier Traversaro, and Guido di Carpigna,
O Romagnuoli into bastards turned?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-100">When in Bologna will a Fabbro rise?
When in Faenza a Bernardin di Fosco,
The noble scion of ignoble seed?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-103">Be not astonished, Tuscan, if I weep,
When I remember, with Guido da Prata,
Ugolin d' Azzo, who was living with us,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-106">Frederick Tignoso and his company,
The house of Traversara, and th' Anastagi,
And one race and the other is extinct;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-109">The dames and cavaliers, the toils and ease
That filled our souls with love and courtesy,
There where the hearts have so malicious grown!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-112">O Brettinoro! why dost thou not flee,
Seeing that all thy family is gone,
And many people, not to be corrupted?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-115">Bagnacaval does well in not begetting
And ill does Castrocaro, and Conio worse,
In taking trouble to beget such Counts.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-118">Will do well the Pagani, when their Devil
Shall have departed; but not therefore pure
Will testimony of them e'er remain.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-121">O Ugolin de' Fantoli, secure
Thy name is, since no longer is awaited
One who, degenerating, can obscure it!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-124">But go now, Tuscan, for it now delights me
To weep far better than it does to speak,
So much has our discourse my mind distressed."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-127">We were aware that those beloved souls
Heard us depart; therefore, by keeping silent,
They made us of our pathway confident.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-130">When we became alone by going onward,
Thunder, when it doth cleave the air, appeared
A voice, that counter to us came, exclaiming:
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-133">"Shall slay me whosoever findeth me!"
And fled as the reverberation dies
If suddenly the cloud asunder bursts.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-136">As soon as hearing had a truce from this,
Behold another, with so great a crash,
That it resembled thunderings following fast:
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-139">"I am Aglaurus, who became a stone!"
And then, to press myself close to the Poet,
I backward, and not forward, took a step.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-142">Already on all sides the air was quiet;
And said he to me: "That was the hard curb
That ought to hold a man within his bounds;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-145">But you take in the bait so that the hook
Of the old Adversary draws you to him,
And hence availeth little curb or call.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-148">The heavens are calling you, and wheel around you,
Displaying to you their eternal beauties,
And still your eye is looking on the ground;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xiv-151">Whence He, who all discerns, chastises you."
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XV

<p id="purgatorio-xv-1">As much as 'twixt the close of the third hour
And dawn of day appeareth of that sphere
Which aye in fashion of a child is playing,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-4">So much it now appeared, towards the night,
Was of his course remaining to the sun;
There it was evening, and 'twas midnight here;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-7">And the rays smote the middle of our faces,
Because by us the mount was so encircled,
That straight towards the west we now were going
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-10">When I perceived my forehead overpowered
Beneath the splendour far more than at first,
And stupor were to me the things unknown,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-13">Whereat towards the summit of my brow
I raised my hands, and made myself the visor
Which the excessive glare diminishes.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-16">As when from off the water, or a mirror,
The sunbeam leaps unto the opposite side,
Ascending upward in the selfsame measure
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-19">That it descends, and deviates as far
From falling of a stone in line direct,
(As demonstrate experiment and art,)
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-22">So it appeared to me that by a light
Refracted there before me I was smitten;
On which account my sight was swift to flee.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-25">"What is that, Father sweet, from which I cannot
So fully screen my sight that it avail me,"
Said I, "and seems towards us to be moving?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-28">"Marvel thou not, if dazzle thee as yet
The family of heaven," he answered me;
"An angel 'tis, who comes to invite us upward.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-31">Soon will it be, that to behold these things
Shall not be grievous, but delightful to thee
As much as nature fashioned thee to feel."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-34">When we had reached the Angel benedight,
With joyful voice he said: "Here enter in
To stairway far less steep than are the others."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-37">We mounting were, already thence departed,
And "Beati misericordes" was
Behind us sung, "Rejoice, thou that o'ercomest!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-40">My Master and myself, we two alone
Were going upward, and I thought, in going,
Some profit to acquire from words of his;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-43">And I to him directed me, thus asking:
"What did the spirit of Romagna mean,
Mentioning interdict and partnership?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-46">Whence he to me: "Of his own greatest failing
He knows the harm; and therefore wonder not
If he reprove us, that we less may rue it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-49">Because are thither pointed your desires
Where by companionship each share is lessened,
Envy doth ply the bellows to your sighs.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-52">But if the love of the supernal sphere
Should upwardly direct your aspiration,
There would not be that fear within your breast;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-55">For there, as much the more as one says 'Our,'
So much the more of good each one possesses,
And more of charity in that cloister burns."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-58">"I am more hungering to be satisfied,"
I said, "than if I had before been silent,
And more of doubt within my mind I gather.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-61">How can it be, that boon distributed
The more possessors can more wealthy make
Therein, than if by few it be possessed?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-64">And he to me: "Because thou fixest still
Thy mind entirely upon earthly things,
Thou pluckest darkness from the very light.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-67">That goodness infinite and ineffable
Which is above there, runneth unto love,
As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-70">So much it gives itself as it finds ardour,
So that as far as charity extends,
O'er it increases the eternal valour.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-73">And the more people thitherward aspire,
More are there to love well, and more they love there,
And, as a mirror, one reflects the other.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-76">And if my reasoning appease thee not,
Thou shalt see Beatrice; and she will fully
Take from thee this and every other longing.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-79">Endeavour, then, that soon may be extinct,
As are the two already, the five wounds
That close themselves again by being painful."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-82">Even as I wished to say, "Thou dost appease me,"
I saw that I had reached another circle,
So that my eager eyes made me keep silence.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-85">There it appeared to me that in a vision
Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt,
And in a temple many persons saw;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-88">And at the door a woman, with the sweet
Behaviour of a mother, saying: "Son,
Why in this manner hast thou dealt with us?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-91">Lo, sorrowing, thy father and myself
Were seeking for thee;"--and as here she ceased,
That which appeared at first had disappeared.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-94">Then I beheld another with those waters
Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever
From great disdain of others it is born,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-97">And saying: "If of that city thou art lord,
For whose name was such strife among the gods,
And whence doth every science scintillate,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-100">Avenge thyself on those audacious arms
That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus;"
And the lord seemed to me benign and mild
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-103">To answer her with aspect temperate:
"What shall we do to those who wish us ill,
If he who loves us be by us condemned?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-106">Then saw I people hot in fire of wrath,
With stones a young man slaying, clamorously
Still crying to each other, "Kill him! kill him!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-109">And him I saw bow down, because of death
That weighed already on him, to the earth,
But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-112">Imploring the high Lord, in so great strife,
That he would pardon those his persecutors,
With such an aspect as unlocks compassion.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-115">Soon as my soul had outwardly returned
To things external to it which are true,
Did I my not false errors recognize.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-118">My Leader, who could see me bear myself
Like to a man that rouses him from sleep,
Exclaimed: "What ails thee, that thou canst not stand?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-121">But hast been coming more than half a league
Veiling thine eyes, and with thy legs entangled,
In guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-124">"O my sweet Father, if thou listen to me,
I'll tell thee," said I, "what appeared to me,
When thus from me my legs were ta'en away."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-127">And he: "If thou shouldst have a hundred masks
Upon thy face, from me would not be shut
Thy cogitations, howsoever small.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-130">What thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail
To ope thy heart unto the waters of peace,
Which from the eternal fountain are diffused.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-133">I did not ask, 'What ails thee?' as he does
Who only looketh with the eyes that see not
When of the soul bereft the body lies,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-136">But asked it to give vigour to thy feet;
Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards, slow
To use their wakefulness when it returns."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-139">We passed along, athwart the twilight peering
Forward as far as ever eye could stretch
Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-142">And lo! by slow degrees a smoke approached
In our direction, sombre as the night,
Nor was there place to hide one's self therefrom.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xv-145">This of our eyes and the pure air bereft us.
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XVI

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-1">Darkness of hell, and of a night deprived
Of every planet under a poor sky,
As much as may be tenebrous with cloud,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-4">Ne'er made unto my sight so thick a veil,
As did that smoke which there enveloped us,
Nor to the feeling of so rough a texture;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-7">For not an eye it suffered to stay open;
Whereat mine escort, faithful and sagacious,
Drew near to me and offered me his shoulder.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-10">E'en as a blind man goes behind his guide,
Lest he should wander, or should strike against
Aught that may harm or peradventure kill him,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-13">So went I through the bitter and foul air,
Listening unto my Leader, who said only,
"Look that from me thou be not separated."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-16">Voices I heard, and every one appeared
To supplicate for peace and misericord
The Lamb of God who takes away our sins.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-19">Still "Agnus Dei" their exordium was;
One word there was in all, and metre one,
So that all harmony appeared among them.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-22">"Master," I said, "are spirits those I hear?"
And he to me: "Thou apprehendest truly,
And they the knot of anger go unloosing."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-25">"Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke
And art discoursing of us even as though
Thou didst by calends still divide the time?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-28">After this manner by a voice was spoken;
Whereon my Master said: "Do thou reply,
And ask if on this side the way go upward."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-31">And I: "O creature that dost cleanse thyself
To return beautiful to Him who made thee,
Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-34">"Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,"
He answered; "and if smoke prevent our seeing,
Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-37">Thereon began I: "With that swathing band
Which death unwindeth am I going upward,
And hither came I through the infernal anguish.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-40">And if God in his grace has me infolded,
So that he wills that I behold his court
By method wholly out of modern usage,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-43">Conceal not from me who ere death thou wast,
But tell it me, and tell me if I go
Right for the pass, and be thy words our escort."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-46">"Lombard was I, and I was Marco called;
The world I knew, and loved that excellence,
At which has each one now unbent his bow.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-49">For mounting upward, thou art going right."
Thus he made answer, and subjoined: "I pray thee
To pray for me when thou shalt be above."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-52">And I to him: "My faith I pledge to thee
To do what thou dost ask me; but am bursting
Inly with doubt, unless I rid me of it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-55">First it was simple, and is now made double
By thy opinion, which makes certain to me,
Here and elsewhere, that which I couple with it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-58">The world forsooth is utterly deserted
By every virtue, as thou tellest me,
And with iniquity is big and covered;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-61">But I beseech thee point me out the cause,
That I may see it, and to others show it;
For one in the heavens, and here below one puts it."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-64">A sigh profound, that grief forced into Ai!
He first sent forth, and then began he: "Brother,
The world is blind, and sooth thou comest from it!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-67">Ye who are living every cause refer
Still upward to the heavens, as if all things
They of necessity moved with themselves.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-70">If this were so, in you would be destroyed
Free will, nor any justice would there be
In having joy for good, or grief for evil.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-73">The heavens your movements do initiate,
I say not all; but granting that I say it,
Light has been given you for good and evil,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-76">And free volition; which, if some fatigue
In the first battles with the heavens it suffers,
Afterwards conquers all, if well 'tis nurtured.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-79">To greater force and to a better nature,
Though free, ye subject are, and that creates
The mind in you the heavens have not in charge.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-82">Hence, if the present world doth go astray,
In you the cause is, be it sought in you;
And I therein will now be thy true spy.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-85">Forth from the hand of Him, who fondles it
Before it is, like to a little girl
Weeping and laughing in her childish sport,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-88">Issues the simple soul, that nothing knows,
Save that, proceeding from a joyous Maker,
Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-91">Of trivial good at first it tastes the savour;
Is cheated by it, and runs after it,
If guide or rein turn not aside its love.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-94">Hence it behoved laws for a rein to place,
Behoved a king to have, who at the least
Of the true city should discern the tower.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-97">The laws exist, but who sets hand to them?
No one; because the shepherd who precedes
Can ruminate, but cleaveth not the hoof;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-100">Wherefore the people that perceives its guide
Strike only at the good for which it hankers,
Feeds upon that, and farther seeketh not.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-103">Clearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance
The cause is that has made the world depraved,
And not that nature is corrupt in you.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-106">Rome, that reformed the world, accustomed was
Two suns to have, which one road and the other,
Of God and of the world, made manifest.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-109">One has the other quenched, and to the crosier
The sword is joined, and ill beseemeth it
That by main force one with the other go,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-112">Because, being joined, one feareth not the other;
If thou believe not, think upon the grain,
For by its seed each herb is recognized.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-115">In the land laved by Po and Adige,
Valour and courtesy used to be found,
Before that Frederick had his controversy;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-118">Now in security can pass that way
Whoever will abstain, through sense of shame,
From speaking with the good, or drawing near them.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-121">True, three old men are left, in whom upbraids
The ancient age the new, and late they deem it
That God restore them to the better life:
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-124">Currado da Palazzo, and good Gherardo,
And Guido da Castel, who better named is,
In fashion of the French, the simple Lombard:
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-127">Say thou henceforward that the Church of Rome,
Confounding in itself two governments,
Falls in the mire, and soils itself and burden."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-130">"O Marco mine," I said, "thou reasonest well;
And now discern I why the sons of Levi
Have been excluded from the heritage.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-133">But what Gherardo is it, who, as sample
Of a lost race, thou sayest has remained
In reprobation of the barbarous age?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-136">"Either thy speech deceives me, or it tempts me,"
He answered me; "for speaking Tuscan to me,
It seems of good Gherardo naught thou knowest.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-139">By other surname do I know him not,
Unless I take it from his daughter Gaia.
May God be with you, for I come no farther.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-142">Behold the dawn, that through the smoke rays out,
Already whitening; and I must depart--
Yonder the Angel is--ere he appear."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvi-145">Thus did he speak, and would no farther hear me.
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XVII

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-1">Remember, Reader, if e'er in the Alps
A mist o'ertook thee, through which thou couldst see
Not otherwise than through its membrane mole,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-4">How, when the vapours humid and condensed
Begin to dissipate themselves, the sphere
Of the sun feebly enters in among them,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-7">And thy imagination will be swift
In coming to perceive how I re-saw
The sun at first, that was already setting.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-10">Thus, to the faithful footsteps of my Master
Mating mine own, I issued from that cloud
To rays already dead on the low shores.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-13">O thou, Imagination, that dost steal us
So from without sometimes, that man perceives not,
Although around may sound a thousand trumpets,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-16">Who moveth thee, if sense impel thee not?
Moves thee a light, which in the heaven takes form,
By self, or by a will that downward guides it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-19">Of her impiety, who changed her form
Into the bird that most delights in singing,
In my imagining appeared the trace;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-22">And hereupon my mind was so withdrawn
Within itself, that from without there came
Nothing that then might be received by it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-25">Then reigned within my lofty fantasy
One crucified, disdainful and ferocious
In countenance, and even thus was dying.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-28">Around him were the great Ahasuerus,
Esther his wife, and the just Mordecai,
Who was in word and action so entire.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-31">And even as this image burst asunder
Of its own self, in fashion of a bubble
In which the water it was made of fails,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-34">There rose up in my vision a young maiden
Bitterly weeping, and she said: "O queen,
Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-37">Thou'st slain thyself, Lavinia not to lose;
Now hast thou lost me; I am she who mourns,
Mother, at thine ere at another's ruin."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-40">As sleep is broken, when upon a sudden
New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed,
And broken quivers ere it dieth wholly,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-43">So this imagining of mine fell down
As soon as the effulgence smote my face,
Greater by far than what is in our wont.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-46">I turned me round to see where I might be,
When said a voice, "Here is the passage up;"
Which from all other purposes removed me,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-49">And made my wish so full of eagerness
To look and see who was it that was speaking,
It never rests till meeting face to face;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-52">But as before the sun, which quells the sight,
And in its own excess its figure veils,
Even so my power was insufficient here.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-55">"This is a spirit divine, who in the way
Of going up directs us without asking,
And who with his own light himself conceals.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-58">He does with us as man doth with himself;
For he who sees the need, and waits the asking,
Malignly leans already tow'rds denial.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-61">Accord we now our feet to such inviting,
Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark;
For then we could not till the day return."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-64">Thus my Conductor said; and I and he
Together turned our footsteps to a stairway;
And I, as soon as the first step I reached,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-67">Near me perceived a motion as of wings,
And fanning in the face, and saying, "'Beati
Pacifici,' who are without ill anger."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-70">Already over us were so uplifted
The latest sunbeams, which the night pursues,
That upon many sides the stars appeared.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-73">"O manhood mine, why dost thou vanish so?"
I said within myself; for I perceived
The vigour of my legs was put in truce.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-76">We at the point were where no more ascends
The stairway upward, and were motionless,
Even as a ship, which at the shore arrives;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-79">And I gave heed a little, if I might hear
Aught whatsoever in the circle new;
Then to my Master turned me round and said:
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-82">"Say, my sweet Father, what delinquency
Is purged here in the circle where we are?
Although our feet may pause, pause not thy speech."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-85">And he to me: "The love of good, remiss
In what it should have done, is here restored;
Here plied again the ill-belated oar;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-88">But still more openly to understand,
Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather
Some profitable fruit from our delay.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-91">Neither Creator nor a creature ever,
Son," he began, "was destitute of love
Natural or spiritual; and thou knowest it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-94">The natural was ever without error;
But err the other may by evil object,
Or by too much, or by too little vigour.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-97">While in the first it well directed is,
And in the second moderates itself,
It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-100">But when to ill it turns, and, with more care
Or lesser than it ought, runs after good,
'Gainst the Creator works his own creation.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-103">Hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be
The seed within yourselves of every virtue,
And every act that merits punishment.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-106">Now inasmuch as never from the welfare
Of its own subject can love turn its sight,
From their own hatred all things are secure;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-109">And since we cannot think of any being
Standing alone, nor from the First divided,
Of hating Him is all desire cut off.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-112">Hence if, discriminating, I judge well,
The evil that one loves is of one's neighbour,
And this is born in three modes in your clay.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-115">There are, who, by abasement of their neighbour,
Hope to excel, and therefore only long
That from his greatness he may be cast down;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-118">There are, who power, grace, honour, and renown
Fear they may lose because another rises,
Thence are so sad that the reverse they love;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-121">And there are those whom injury seems to chafe,
So that it makes them greedy for revenge,
And such must needs shape out another's harm.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-124">This threefold love is wept for down below;
Now of the other will I have thee hear,
That runneth after good with measure faulty.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-127">Each one confusedly a good conceives
Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it;
Therefore to overtake it each one strives.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-130">If languid love to look on this attract you,
Or in attaining unto it, this cornice,
After just penitence, torments you for it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-133">There's other good that does not make man happy;
'Tis not felicity, 'tis not the good
Essence, of every good the fruit and root.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-136">The love that yields itself too much to this
Above us is lamented in three circles;
But how tripartite it may be described,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xvii-139">I say not, that thou seek it for thyself."
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XVIII

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-1">An end had put unto his reasoning
The lofty Teacher, and attent was looking
Into my face, if I appeared content;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-4">And I, whom a new thirst still goaded on,
Without was mute, and said within: "Perchance
The too much questioning I make annoys him."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-7">But that true Father, who had comprehended
The timid wish, that opened not itself,
By speaking gave me hardihood to speak.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-10">Whence I: "My sight is, Master, vivified
So in thy light, that clearly I discern
Whate'er thy speech importeth or describes.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-13">Therefore I thee entreat, sweet Father dear,
To teach me love, to which thou dost refer
Every good action and its contrary."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-16">"Direct," he said, "towards me the keen eyes
Of intellect, and clear will be to thee
The error of the blind, who would be leaders.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-19">The soul, which is created apt to love,
Is mobile unto everything that pleases,
Soon as by pleasure she is waked to action.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-22">Your apprehension from some real thing
An image draws, and in yourselves displays it
So that it makes the soul turn unto it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-25">And if, when turned, towards it she incline,
Love is that inclination; it is nature,
Which is by pleasure bound in you anew
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-28">Then even as the fire doth upward move
By its own form, which to ascend is born,
Where longest in its matter it endures,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-31">So comes the captive soul into desire,
Which is a motion spiritual, and ne'er rests
Until she doth enjoy the thing beloved.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-34">Now may apparent be to thee how hidden
The truth is from those people, who aver
All love is in itself a laudable thing;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-37">Because its matter may perchance appear
Aye to be good; but yet not each impression
Is good, albeit good may be the wax."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-40">"Thy words, and my sequacious intellect,"
I answered him, "have love revealed to me;
But that has made me more impregned with doubt;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-43">For if love from without be offered us,
And with another foot the soul go not,
If right or wrong she go, 'tis not her merit."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-46">And he to me: "What reason seeth here,
Myself can tell thee; beyond that await
For Beatrice, since 'tis a work of faith.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-49">Every substantial form, that segregate
From matter is, and with it is united,
Specific power has in itself collected,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-52">Which without act is not perceptible,
Nor shows itself except by its effect,
As life does in a plant by the green leaves.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-55">But still, whence cometh the intelligence
Of the first notions, man is ignorant,
And the affection for the first allurements,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-58">Which are in you as instinct in the bee
To make its honey; and this first desire
Merit of praise or blame containeth not.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-61">Now, that to this all others may be gathered,
Innate within you is the power that counsels,
And it should keep the threshold of assent.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-64">This is the principle, from which is taken
Occasion of desert in you, according
As good and guilty loves it takes and winnows.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-67">Those who, in reasoning, to the bottom went,
Were of this innate liberty aware,
Therefore bequeathed they Ethics to the world.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-70">Supposing, then, that from necessity
Springs every love that is within you kindled,
Within yourselves the power is to restrain it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-73">The noble virtue Beatrice understands
By the free will; and therefore see that thou
Bear it in mind, if she should speak of it."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-76">The moon, belated almost unto midnight,
Now made the stars appear to us more rare,
Formed like a bucket, that is all ablaze,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-79">And counter to the heavens ran through those paths
Which the sun sets aflame, when he of Rome
Sees it 'twixt Sardes and Corsicans go down;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-82">And that patrician shade, for whom is named
Pietola more than any Mantuan town,
Had laid aside the burden of my lading;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-85">Whence I, who reason manifest and plain
In answer to my questions had received,
Stood like a man in drowsy reverie.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-88">But taken from me was this drowsiness
Suddenly by a people, that behind
Our backs already had come round to us.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-91">And as, of old, Ismenus and Asopus
Beside them saw at night the rush and throng,
If but the Thebans were in need of Bacchus,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-94">So they along that circle curve their step,
From what I saw of those approaching us,
Who by good-will and righteous love are ridden.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-97">Full soon they were upon us, because running
Moved onward all that mighty multitude,
And two in the advance cried out, lamenting,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-100">"Mary in haste unto the mountain ran,
And Caesar, that he might subdue Ilerda,
Thrust at Marseilles, and then ran into Spain."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-103">"Quick! quick! so that the time may not be lost
By little love!" forthwith the others cried,
"For ardour in well-doing freshens grace!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-106">"O folk, in whom an eager fervour now
Supplies perhaps delay and negligence,
Put by you in well-doing, through lukewarmness,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-109">This one who lives, and truly I lie not,
Would fain go up, if but the sun relight us;
So tell us where the passage nearest is."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-112">These were the words of him who was my Guide;
And some one of those spirits said: "Come on
Behind us, and the opening shalt thou find;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-115">So full of longing are we to move onward,
That stay we cannot; therefore pardon us,
If thou for churlishness our justice take.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-118">I was San Zeno's Abbot at Verona,
Under the empire of good Barbarossa,
Of whom still sorrowing Milan holds discourse;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-121">And he has one foot in the grave already,
Who shall erelong lament that monastery,
And sorry be of having there had power,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-124">Because his son, in his whole body sick,
And worse in mind, and who was evil-born,
He put into the place of its true pastor."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-127">If more he said, or silent was, I know not,
He had already passed so far beyond us;
But this I heard, and to retain it pleased me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-130">And he who was in every need my succour
Said: "Turn thee hitherward; see two of them
Come fastening upon slothfulness their teeth."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-133">In rear of all they shouted: "Sooner were
The people dead to whom the sea was opened,
Than their inheritors the Jordan saw;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-136">And those who the fatigue did not endure
Unto the issue, with Anchises' son,
Themselves to life withouten glory offered."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-139">Then when from us so separated were
Those shades, that they no longer could be seen,
Within me a new thought did entrance find,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-142">Whence others many and diverse were born;
And so I lapsed from one into another,
That in a reverie mine eyes I closed,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xviii-145">And meditation into dream transmuted.
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XIX

<p id="purgatorio-xix-1">It was the hour when the diurnal heat
No more can warm the coldness of the moon,
Vanquished by earth, or peradventure Saturn,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-4">When geomancers their Fortuna Major
See in the orient before the dawn
Rise by a path that long remains not dim,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-7">There came to me in dreams a stammering woman,
Squint in her eyes, and in her feet distorted,
With hands dissevered and of sallow hue.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-10">I looked at her; and as the sun restores
The frigid members which the night benumbs,
Even thus my gaze did render voluble
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-13">Her tongue, and made her all erect thereafter
In little while, and the lost countenance
As love desires it so in her did colour.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-16">When in this wise she had her speech unloosed,
She 'gan to sing so, that with difficulty
Could I have turned my thoughts away from her.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-19">"I am," she sang, "I am the Siren sweet
Who mariners amid the main unman,
So full am I of pleasantness to hear.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-22">I drew Ulysses from his wandering way
Unto my song, and he who dwells with me
Seldom departs so wholly I content him."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-25">Her mouth was not yet closed again, before
Appeared a Lady saintly and alert
Close at my side to put her to confusion.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-28">"Virgilius, O Virgilius! who is this?"
Sternly she said; and he was drawing near
With eyes still fixed upon that modest one.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-31">She seized the other and in front laid open,
Rending her garments, and her belly showed me;
This waked me with the stench that issued from it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-34">I turned mine eyes, and good Virgilius said:
"At least thrice have I called thee; rise and come;
Find we the opening by which thou mayst enter."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-37">I rose; and full already of high day
Were all the circles of the Sacred Mountain,
And with the new sun at our back we went.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-40">Following behind him, I my forehead bore
Like unto one who has it laden with thought,
Who makes himself the half arch of a bridge,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-43">When I heard say, "Come, here the passage is,"
Spoken in a manner gentle and benign,
Such as we hear not in this mortal region.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-46">With open wings, which of a swan appeared,
Upward he turned us who thus spake to us,
Between the two walls of the solid granite.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-49">He moved his pinions afterwards and fanned us,
Affirming those 'qui lugent' to be blessed,
For they shall have their souls with comfort filled.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-52">"What aileth thee, that aye to earth thou gazest?"
To me my Guide began to say, we both
Somewhat beyond the Angel having mounted.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-55">And I: "With such misgiving makes me go
A vision new, which bends me to itself,
So that I cannot from the thought withdraw me."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-58">"Didst thou behold," he said, "that old enchantress,
Who sole above us henceforth is lamented?
Didst thou behold how man is freed from her?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-61">Suffice it thee, and smite earth with thy heels,
Thine eyes lift upward to the lure, that whirls
The Eternal King with revolutions vast."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-64">Even as the hawk, that first his feet surveys,
Then turns him to the call and stretches forward,
Through the desire of food that draws him thither,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-67">Such I became, and such, as far as cleaves
The rock to give a way to him who mounts,
Went on to where the circling doth begin.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-70">On the fifth circle when I had come forth,
People I saw upon it who were weeping,
Stretched prone upon the ground, all downward turned.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-73">"Adhaesit pavimento anima mea,"
I heard them say with sighings so profound,
That hardly could the words be understood.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-76">"O ye elect of God, whose sufferings
Justice and Hope both render less severe,
Direct ye us towards the high ascents."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-79">"If ye are come secure from this prostration,
And wish to find the way most speedily,
Let your right hands be evermore outside."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-82">Thus did the Poet ask, and thus was answered
By them somewhat in front of us; whence I
In what was spoken divined the rest concealed,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-85">And unto my Lord's eyes mine eyes I turned;
Whence he assented with a cheerful sign
To what the sight of my desire implored.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-88">When of myself I could dispose at will,
Above that creature did I draw myself,
Whose words before had caused me to take note,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-91">Saying: "O Spirit, in whom weeping ripens
That without which to God we cannot turn,
Suspend awhile for me thy greater care.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-94">Who wast thou, and why are your backs turned upwards,
Tell me, and if thou wouldst that I procure thee
Anything there whence living I departed."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-97">And he to me: "Wherefore our backs the heaven
Turns to itself, know shalt thou; but beforehand
'Scias quod ego fui successor Petri.'
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-100">Between Siestri and Chiaveri descends
A river beautiful, and of its name
The title of my blood its summit makes.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-103">A month and little more essayed I how
Weighs the great cloak on him from mire who keeps it,
For all the other burdens seem a feather.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-106">Tardy, ah woe is me! was my conversion;
But when the Roman Shepherd I was made,
Then I discovered life to be a lie.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-109">I saw that there the heart was not at rest,
Nor farther in that life could one ascend;
Whereby the love of this was kindled in me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-112">Until that time a wretched soul and parted
From God was I, and wholly avaricious;
Now, as thou seest, I here am punished for it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-115">What avarice does is here made manifest
In the purgation of these souls converted,
And no more bitter pain the Mountain has.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-118">Even as our eye did not uplift itself
Aloft, being fastened upon earthly things,
So justice here has merged it in the earth.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-121">As avarice had extinguished our affection
For every good, whereby was action lost,
So justice here doth hold us in restraint,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-124">Bound and imprisoned by the feet and hands;
And so long as it pleases the just Lord
Shall we remain immovable and prostrate."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-127">I on my knees had fallen, and wished to speak;
But even as I began, and he was 'ware,
Only by listening, of my reverence,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-130">"What cause," he said, "has downward bent thee thus?"
And I to him: "For your own dignity,
Standing, my conscience stung me with remorse."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-133">"Straighten thy legs, and upward raise thee, brother,"
He answered: "Err not, fellow-servant am I
With thee and with the others to one power.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-136">If e'er that holy, evangelic sound,
Which sayeth 'neque nubent,' thou hast heard,
Well canst thou see why in this wise I speak.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-139">Now go; no longer will I have thee linger,
Because thy stay doth incommode my weeping,
With which I ripen that which thou hast said.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-142">On earth I have a grandchild named Alagia,
Good in herself, unless indeed our house
Malevolent may make her by example,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xix-145">And she alone remains to me on earth."
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XX

<p id="purgatorio-xx-1">Ill strives the will against a better will;
Therefore, to pleasure him, against my pleasure
I drew the sponge not saturate from the water.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-4">Onward I moved, and onward moved my Leader,
Through vacant places, skirting still the rock,
As on a wall close to the battlements;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-7">For they that through their eyes pour drop by drop
The malady which all the world pervades,
On the other side too near the verge approach.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-10">Accursed mayst thou be, thou old she-wolf,
That more than all the other beasts hast prey,
Because of hunger infinitely hollow!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-13">O heaven, in whose gyrations some appear
To think conditions here below are changed,
When will he come through whom she shall depart?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-16">Onward we went with footsteps slow and scarce,
And I attentive to the shades I heard
Piteously weeping and bemoaning them;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-19">And I by peradventure heard "Sweet Mary!"
Uttered in front of us amid the weeping
Even as a woman does who is in child-birth;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-22">And in continuance: "How poor thou wast
Is manifested by that hostelry
Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-25">Thereafterward I heard: "O good Fabricius,
Virtue with poverty didst thou prefer
To the possession of great wealth with vice."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-28">So pleasurable were these words to me
That I drew farther onward to have knowledge
Touching that spirit whence they seemed to come.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-31">He furthermore was speaking of the largess
Which Nicholas unto the maidens gave,
In order to conduct their youth to honour.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-34">"O soul that dost so excellently speak,
Tell me who wast thou," said I, "and why only
Thou dost renew these praises well deserved?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-37">Not without recompense shall be thy word,
If I return to finish the short journey
Of that life which is flying to its end."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-40">And he: "I'll tell thee, not for any comfort
I may expect from earth, but that so much
Grace shines in thee or ever thou art dead.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-43">I was the root of that malignant plant
Which overshadows all the Christian world,
So that good fruit is seldom gathered from it;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-46">But if Douay and Ghent, and Lille and Bruges
Had Power, soon vengeance would be taken on it;
And this I pray of Him who judges all.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-49">Hugh Capet was I called upon the earth;
From me were born the Louises and Philips,
By whom in later days has France been governed.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-52">I was the son of a Parisian butcher,
What time the ancient kings had perished all,
Excepting one, contrite in cloth of gray.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-55">I found me grasping in my hands the rein
Of the realm's government, and so great power
Of new acquest, and so with friends abounding,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-58">That to the widowed diadem promoted
The head of mine own offspring was, from whom
The consecrated bones of these began.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-61">So long as the great dowry of Provence
Out of my blood took not the sense of shame,
'Twas little worth, but still it did no harm.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-64">Then it began with falsehood and with force
Its rapine; and thereafter, for amends,
Took Ponthieu, Normandy, and Gascony.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-67">Charles came to Italy, and for amends
A victim made of Conradin, and then
Thrust Thomas back to heaven, for amends.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-70">A time I see, not very distant now,
Which draweth forth another Charles from France,
The better to make known both him and his.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-73">Unarmed he goes, and only with the lance
That Judas jousted with; and that he thrusts
So that he makes the paunch of Florence burst.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-76">He thence not land, but sin and infamy,
Shall gain, so much more grievous to himself
As the more light such damage he accounts.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-79">The other, now gone forth, ta'en in his ship,
See I his daughter sell, and chaffer for her
As corsairs do with other female slaves.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-82">What more, O Avarice, canst thou do to us,
Since thou my blood so to thyself hast drawn,
It careth not for its own proper flesh?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-85">That less may seem the future ill and past,
I see the flower-de-luce Alagna enter,
And Christ in his own Vicar captive made.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-88">I see him yet another time derided;
I see renewed the vinegar and gall,
And between living thieves I see him slain.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-91">I see the modern Pilate so relentless,
This does not sate him, but without decretal
He to the temple bears his sordid sails!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-94">When, O my Lord! shall I be joyful made
By looking on the vengeance which, concealed,
Makes sweet thine anger in thy secrecy?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-97">What I was saying of that only bride
Of the Holy Ghost, and which occasioned thee
To turn towards me for some commentary,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-100">So long has been ordained to all our prayers
As the day lasts; but when the night comes on,
Contrary sound we take instead thereof.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-103">At that time we repeat Pygmalion,
Of whom a traitor, thief, and parricide
Made his insatiable desire of gold;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-106">And the misery of avaricious Midas,
That followed his inordinate demand,
At which forevermore one needs but laugh.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-109">The foolish Achan each one then records,
And how he stole the spoils; so that the wrath
Of Joshua still appears to sting him here.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-112">Then we accuse Sapphira with her husband,
We laud the hoof-beats Heliodorus had,
And the whole mount in infamy encircles
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-115">Polymnestor who murdered Polydorus.
Here finally is cried: 'O Crassus, tell us,
For thou dost know, what is the taste of gold?'
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-118">Sometimes we speak, one loud, another low,
According to desire of speech, that spurs us
To greater now and now to lesser pace.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-121">But in the good that here by day is talked of,
Erewhile alone I was not; yet near by
No other person lifted up his voice."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-124">From him already we departed were,
And made endeavour to o'ercome the road
As much as was permitted to our power,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-127">When I perceived, like something that is falling,
The mountain tremble, whence a chill seized on me,
As seizes him who to his death is going.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-130">Certes so violently shook not Delos,
Before Latona made her nest therein
To give birth to the two eyes of the heaven.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-133">Then upon all sides there began a cry,
Such that the Master drew himself towards me,
Saying, "Fear not, while I am guiding thee."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-136">"Gloria in excelsis Deo," all
Were saying, from what near I comprehended,
Where it was possible to hear the cry.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-139">We paused immovable and in suspense,
Even as the shepherds who first heard that song,
Until the trembling ceased, and it was finished.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-142">Then we resumed again our holy path,
Watching the shades that lay upon the ground,
Already turned to their accustomed plaint.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-145">No ignorance ever with so great a strife
Had rendered me importunate to know,
If erreth not in this my memory,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-148">As meditating then I seemed to have;
Nor out of haste to question did I dare,
Nor of myself I there could aught perceive;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xx-151">So I went onward timorous and thoughtful.
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XXI

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-1">The natural thirst, that ne'er is satisfied
Excepting with the water for whose grace
The woman of Samaria besought,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-4">Put me in travail, and haste goaded me
Along the encumbered path behind my Leader
And I was pitying that righteous vengeance;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-7">And lo! in the same manner as Luke writeth
That Christ appeared to two upon the way
From the sepulchral cave already risen,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-10">A shade appeared to us, and came behind us,
Down gazing on the prostrate multitude,
Nor were we ware of it, until it spake,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-13">Saying, "My brothers, may God give you peace!"
We turned us suddenly, and Virgilius rendered
To him the countersign thereto conforming.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-16">Thereon began he: "In the blessed council,
Thee may the court veracious place in peace,
That me doth banish in eternal exile!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-19">"How," said he, and the while we went with speed,
"If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high,
Who up his stairs so far has guided you?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-22">And said my Teacher: "If thou note the marks
Which this one bears, and which the Angel traces
Well shalt thou see he with the good must reign.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-25">But because she who spinneth day and night
For him had not yet drawn the distaff off,
Which Clotho lays for each one and compacts,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-28">His soul, which is thy sister and my own,
In coming upwards could not come alone,
By reason that it sees not in our fashion.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-31">Whence I was drawn from out the ample throat
Of Hell to be his guide, and I shall guide him
As far on as my school has power to lead.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-34">But tell us, if thou knowest, why such a shudder
Erewhile the mountain gave, and why together
All seemed to cry, as far as its moist feet?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-37">In asking he so hit the very eye
Of my desire, that merely with the hope
My thirst became the less unsatisfied.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-40">"Naught is there," he began, "that without order
May the religion of the mountain feel,
Nor aught that may be foreign to its custom.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-43">Free is it here from every permutation;
What from itself heaven in itself receiveth
Can be of this the cause, and naught beside;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-46">Because that neither rain, nor hail, nor snow,
Nor dew, nor hoar-frost any higher falls
Than the short, little stairway of three steps.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-49">Dense clouds do not appear, nor rarefied,
Nor coruscation, nor the daughter of Thaumas,
That often upon earth her region shifts;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-52">No arid vapour any farther rises
Than to the top of the three steps I spake of,
Whereon the Vicar of Peter has his feet.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-55">Lower down perchance it trembles less or more,
But, for the wind that in the earth is hidden
I know not how, up here it never trembled.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-58">It trembles here, whenever any soul
Feels itself pure, so that it soars, or moves
To mount aloft, and such a cry attends it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-61">Of purity the will alone gives proof,
Which, being wholly free to change its convent,
Takes by surprise the soul, and helps it fly.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-64">First it wills well; but the desire permits not,
Which divine justice with the self-same will
There was to sin, upon the torment sets.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-67">And I, who have been lying in this pain
Five hundred years and more, but just now felt
A free volition for a better seat.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-70">Therefore thou heardst the earthquake, and the pious
Spirits along the mountain rendering praise
Unto the Lord, that soon he speed them upwards."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-73">So said he to him; and since we enjoy
As much in drinking as the thirst is great,
I could not say how much it did me good.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-76">And the wise Leader: "Now I see the net
That snares you here, and how ye are set free,
Why the earth quakes, and wherefore ye rejoice.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-79">Now who thou wast be pleased that I may know;
And why so many centuries thou hast here
Been lying, let me gather from thy words."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-82">"In days when the good Titus, with the aid
Of the supremest King, avenged the wounds
Whence issued forth the blood by Judas sold,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-85">Under the name that most endures and honours,
Was I on earth," that spirit made reply,
"Greatly renowned, but not with faith as yet.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-88">My vocal spirit was so sweet, that Rome
Me, a Thoulousian, drew unto herself,
Where I deserved to deck my brows with myrtle.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-91">Statius the people name me still on earth;
I sang of Thebes, and then of great Achilles;
But on the way fell with my second burden.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-94">The seeds unto my ardour were the sparks
Of that celestial flame which heated me,
Whereby more than a thousand have been fired;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-97">Of the Aeneid speak I, which to me
A mother was, and was my nurse in song;
Without this weighed I not a drachma's weight.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-100">And to have lived upon the earth what time
Virgilius lived, I would accept one sun
More than I must ere issuing from my ban."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-103">These words towards me made Virgilius turn
With looks that in their silence said, "Be silent!"
But yet the power that wills cannot do all things;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-106">For tears and laughter are such pursuivants
Unto the passion from which each springs forth,
In the most truthful least the will they follow.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-109">I only smiled, as one who gives the wink;
Whereat the shade was silent, and it gazed
Into mine eyes, where most expression dwells;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-112">And, "As thou well mayst consummate a labour
So great," it said, "why did thy face just now
Display to me the lightning of a smile?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-115">Now am I caught on this side and on that;
One keeps me silent, one to speak conjures me,
Wherefore I sigh, and I am understood.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-118">"Speak," said my Master, "and be not afraid
Of speaking, but speak out, and say to him
What he demands with such solicitude."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-121">Whence I: "Thou peradventure marvellest,
O antique spirit, at the smile I gave;
But I will have more wonder seize upon thee.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-124">This one, who guides on high these eyes of mine,
Is that Virgilius, from whom thou didst learn
To sing aloud of men and of the Gods.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-127">If other cause thou to my smile imputedst,
Abandon it as false, and trust it was
Those words which thou hast spoken concerning him."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-130">Already he was stooping to embrace
My Teacher's feet; but he said to him: "Brother,
Do not; for shade thou art, and shade beholdest."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-133">And he uprising: "Now canst thou the sum
Of love which warms me to thee comprehend,
When this our vanity I disremember,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxi-136">Treating a shadow as substantial thing."
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XXII

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-1">Already was the Angel left behind us,
The Angel who to the sixth round had turned us,
Having erased one mark from off my face;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-4">And those who have in justice their desire
Had said to us, "Beati," in their voices,
With "sitio," and without more ended it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-7">And I, more light than through the other passes,
Went onward so, that without any labour
I followed upward the swift-footed spirits;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-10">When thus Virgilius began: "The love
Kindled by virtue aye another kindles,
Provided outwardly its flame appear.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-13">Hence from the hour that Juvenal descended
Among us into the infernal Limbo,
Who made apparent to me thy affection,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-16">My kindliness towards thee was as great
As ever bound one to an unseen person,
So that these stairs will now seem short to me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-19">But tell me, and forgive me as a friend,
If too great confidence let loose the rein,
And as a friend now hold discourse with me;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-22">How was it possible within thy breast
For avarice to find place, 'mid so much wisdom
As thou wast filled with by thy diligence?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-25">These words excited Statius at first
Somewhat to laughter; afterward he answered:
"Each word of thine is love's dear sign to me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-28">Verily oftentimes do things appear
Which give fallacious matter to our doubts,
Instead of the true causes which are hidden!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-31">Thy question shows me thy belief to be
That I was niggard in the other life,
It may be from the circle where I was;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-34">Therefore know thou, that avarice was removed
Too far from me; and this extravagance
Thousands of lunar periods have punished.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-37">And were it not that I my thoughts uplifted,
When I the passage heard where thou exclaimest,
As if indignant, unto human nature,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-40">'To what impellest thou not, O cursed hunger
Of gold, the appetite of mortal men?'
Revolving I should feel the dismal joustings.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-43">Then I perceived the hands could spread too wide
Their wings in spending, and repented me
As well of that as of my other sins;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-46">How many with shorn hair shall rise again
Because of ignorance, which from this sin
Cuts off repentance living and in death!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-49">And know that the transgression which rebuts
By direct opposition any sin
Together with it here its verdure dries.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-52">Therefore if I have been among that folk
Which mourns its avarice, to purify me,
For its opposite has this befallen me."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-55">"Now when thou sangest the relentless weapons
Of the twofold affliction of Jocasta,"
The singer of the Songs Bucolic said,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-58">"From that which Clio there with thee preludes,
It does not seem that yet had made thee faithful
That faith without which no good works suffice.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-61">If this be so, what candles or what sun
Scattered thy darkness so that thou didst trim
Thy sails behind the Fisherman thereafter?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-64">And he to him: "Thou first directedst me
Towards Parnassus, in its grots to drink,
And first concerning God didst me enlighten.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-67">Thou didst as he who walketh in the night,
Who bears his light behind, which helps him not,
But wary makes the persons after him,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-70">When thou didst say: 'The age renews itself,
Justice returns, and man's primeval time,
And a new progeny descends from heaven.'
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-73">Through thee I Poet was, through thee a Christian;
But that thou better see what I design,
To colour it will I extend my hand.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-76">Already was the world in every part
Pregnant with the true creed, disseminated
By messengers of the eternal kingdom;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-79">And thy assertion, spoken of above,
With the new preachers was in unison;
Whence I to visit them the custom took.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-82">Then they became so holy in my sight,
That, when Domitian persecuted them,
Not without tears of mine were their laments;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-85">And all the while that I on earth remained,
Them I befriended, and their upright customs
Made me disparage all the other sects.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-88">And ere I led the Greeks unto the rivers
Of Thebes, in poetry, I was baptized,
But out of fear was covertly a Christian,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-91">For a long time professing paganism;
And this lukewarmness caused me the fourth circle
To circuit round more than four centuries.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-94">Thou, therefore, who hast raised the covering
That hid from me whatever good I speak of,
While in ascending we have time to spare,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-97">Tell me, in what place is our friend Terentius,
Caecilius, Plautus, Varro, if thou knowest;
Tell me if they are damned, and in what alley."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-100">"These, Persius and myself, and others many,"
Replied my Leader, "with that Grecian are
Whom more than all the rest the Muses suckled,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-103">In the first circle of the prison blind;
Ofttimes we of the mountain hold discourse
Which has our nurses ever with itself.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-106">Euripides is with us, Antiphon,
Simonides, Agatho, and many other
Greeks who of old their brows with laurel decked.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-109">There some of thine own people may be seen,
Antigone, Deiphile and Argia,
And there Ismene mournful as of old.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-112">There she is seen who pointed out Langia;
There is Tiresias' daughter, and there Thetis,
And there Deidamia with her sisters."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-115">Silent already were the poets both,
Attent once more in looking round about,
From the ascent and from the walls released;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-118">And four handmaidens of the day already
Were left behind, and at the pole the fifth
Was pointing upward still its burning horn,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-121">What time my Guide: "I think that tow'rds the edge
Our dexter shoulders it behoves us turn,
Circling the mount as we are wont to do."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-124">Thus in that region custom was our ensign;
And we resumed our way with less suspicion
For the assenting of that worthy soul
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-127">They in advance went on, and I alone
Behind them, and I listened to their speech,
Which gave me lessons in the art of song.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-130">But soon their sweet discourses interrupted
A tree which midway in the road we found,
With apples sweet and grateful to the smell.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-133">And even as a fir-tree tapers upward
From bough to bough, so downwardly did that;
I think in order that no one might climb it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-136">On that side where our pathway was enclosed
Fell from the lofty rock a limpid water,
And spread itself abroad upon the leaves.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-139">The Poets twain unto the tree drew near,
And from among the foliage a voice
Cried: "Of this food ye shall have scarcity."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-142">Then said: "More thoughtful Mary was of making
The marriage feast complete and honourable,
Than of her mouth which now for you responds;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-145">And for their drink the ancient Roman women
With water were content; and Daniel
Disparaged food, and understanding won.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-148">The primal age was beautiful as gold;
Acorns it made with hunger savorous,
And nectar every rivulet with thirst.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-151">Honey and locusts were the aliments
That fed the Baptist in the wilderness;
Whence he is glorious, and so magnified
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxii-154">As by the Evangel is revealed to you."
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XXIII

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-1">The while among the verdant leaves mine eyes
I riveted, as he is wont to do
Who wastes his life pursuing little birds,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-4">My more than Father said unto me: "Son,
Come now; because the time that is ordained us
More usefully should be apportioned out."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-7">I turned my face and no less soon my steps
Unto the Sages, who were speaking so
They made the going of no cost to me;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-10">And lo! were heard a song and a lament,
"Labia mea, Domine," in fashion
Such that delight and dolence it brought forth.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-13">"O my sweet Father, what is this I hear?"
Began I; and he answered: "Shades that go
Perhaps the knot unloosing of their debt."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-16">In the same way that thoughtful pilgrims do,
Who, unknown people on the road o'ertaking,
Turn themselves round to them, and do not stop,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-19">Even thus, behind us with a swifter motion
Coming and passing onward, gazed upon us
A crowd of spirits silent and devout.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-22">Each in his eyes was dark and cavernous,
Pallid in face, and so emaciate
That from the bones the skin did shape itself.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-25">I do not think that so to merest rind
Could Erisichthon have been withered up
By famine, when most fear he had of it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-28">Thinking within myself I said: "Behold,
This is the folk who lost Jerusalem,
When Mary made a prey of her own son."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-31">Their sockets were like rings without the gems;
Whoever in the face of men reads 'omo'
Might well in these have recognised the 'm.'
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-34">Who would believe the odour of an apple,
Begetting longing, could consume them so,
And that of water, without knowing how?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-37">I still was wondering what so famished them,
For the occasion not yet manifest
Of their emaciation and sad squalor;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-40">And lo! from out the hollow of his head
His eyes a shade turned on me, and looked keenly;
Then cried aloud: "What grace to me is this?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-43">Never should I have known him by his look;
But in his voice was evident to me
That which his aspect had suppressed within it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-46">This spark within me wholly re-enkindled
My recognition of his altered face,
And I recalled the features of Forese.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-49">"Ah, do not look at this dry leprosy,"
Entreated he, "which doth my skin discolour,
Nor at default of flesh that I may have;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-52">But tell me truth of thee, and who are those
Two souls, that yonder make for thee an escort;
Do not delay in speaking unto me."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-55">"That face of thine, which dead I once bewept,
Gives me for weeping now no lesser grief,"
I answered him, "beholding it so changed!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-58">But tell me, for God's sake, what thus denudes you?
Make me not speak while I am marvelling,
For ill speaks he who's full of other longings."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-61">And he to me: "From the eternal council
Falls power into the water and the tree
Behind us left, whereby I grow so thin.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-64">All of this people who lamenting sing,
For following beyond measure appetite
In hunger and thirst are here re-sanctified.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-67">Desire to eat and drink enkindles in us
The scent that issues from the apple-tree,
And from the spray that sprinkles o'er the verdure;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-70">And not a single time alone, this ground
Encompassing, is refreshed our pain,--
I say our pain, and ought to say our solace,--
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-73">For the same wish doth lead us to the tree
Which led the Christ rejoicing to say 'Eli,'
When with his veins he liberated us."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-76">And I to him: "Forese, from that day
When for a better life thou changedst worlds,
Up to this time five years have not rolled round.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-79">If sooner were the power exhausted in thee
Of sinning more, than thee the hour surprised
Of that good sorrow which to God reweds us,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-82">How hast thou come up hitherward already?
I thought to find thee down there underneath,
Where time for time doth restitution make."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-85">And he to me: "Thus speedily has led me
To drink of the sweet wormwood of these torments,
My Nella with her overflowing tears;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-88">She with her prayers devout and with her sighs
Has drawn me from the coast where one where one awaits,
And from the other circles set me free.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-91">So much more dear and pleasing is to God
My little widow, whom so much I loved,
As in good works she is the more alone;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-94">For the Barbagia of Sardinia
By far more modest in its women is
Than the Barbagia I have left her in.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-97">O brother sweet, what wilt thou have me say?
A future time is in my sight already,
To which this hour will not be very old,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-100">When from the pulpit shall be interdicted
To the unblushing womankind of Florence
To go about displaying breast and paps.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-103">What savages were e'er, what Saracens,
Who stood in need, to make them covered go,
Of spiritual or other discipline?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-106">But if the shameless women were assured
Of what swift Heaven prepares for them, already
Wide open would they have their mouths to howl;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-109">For if my foresight here deceive me not,
They shall be sad ere he has bearded cheeks
Who now is hushed to sleep with lullaby.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-112">O brother, now no longer hide thee from me;
See that not only I, but all these people
Are gazing there, where thou dost veil the sun."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-115">Whence I to him: "If thou bring back to mind
What thou with me hast been and I with thee,
The present memory will be grievous still.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-118">Out of that life he turned me back who goes
In front of me, two days agone when round
The sister of him yonder showed herself,"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-121">And to the sun I pointed.  "Through the deep
Night of the truly dead has this one led me,
With this true flesh, that follows after him.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-124">Thence his encouragements have led me up,
Ascending and still circling round the mount
That you doth straighten, whom the world made crooked.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-127">He says that he will bear me company,
Till I shall be where Beatrice will be;
There it behoves me to remain without him.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-130">This is Virgilius, who thus says to me,"
And him I pointed at; "the other is
That shade for whom just now shook every slope
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiii-133">Your realm, that from itself discharges him."
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XXIV

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-1">Nor speech the going, nor the going that
Slackened; but talking we went bravely on,
Even as a vessel urged by a good wind.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-4">And shadows, that appeared things doubly dead,
From out the sepulchres of their eyes betrayed
Wonder at me, aware that I was living.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-7">And I, continuing my colloquy,
Said: "Peradventure he goes up more slowly
Than he would do, for other people's sake.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-10">But tell me, if thou knowest, where is Piccarda;
Tell me if any one of note I see
Among this folk that gazes at me so."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-13">"My sister, who, 'twixt beautiful and good,
I know not which was more, triumphs rejoicing
Already in her crown on high Olympus."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-16">So said he first, and then: "'Tis not forbidden
To name each other here, so milked away
Is our resemblance by our dieting.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-19">This," pointing with his finger, "is Buonagiunta,
Buonagiunta, of Lucca; and that face
Beyond him there, more peaked than the others,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-22">Has held the holy Church within his arms;
From Tours was he, and purges by his fasting
Bolsena's eels and the Vernaccia wine."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-25">He named me many others one by one;
And all contented seemed at being named,
So that for this I saw not one dark look.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-28">I saw for hunger bite the empty air
Ubaldin dalla Pila, and Boniface,
Who with his crook had pastured many people.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-31">I saw Messer Marchese, who had leisure
Once at Forli for drinking with less dryness,
And he was one who ne'er felt satisfied.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-34">But as he does who scans, and then doth prize
One more than others, did I him of Lucca,
Who seemed to take most cognizance of me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-37">He murmured, and I know not what Gentucca
From that place heard I, where he felt the wound
Of justice, that doth macerate them so.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-40">"O soul," I said, "that seemest so desirous
To speak with me, do so that I may hear thee,
And with thy speech appease thyself and me."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-43">"A maid is born, and wears not yet the veil,"
Began he, "who to thee shall pleasant make
My city, howsoever men may blame it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-46">Thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision;
If by my murmuring thou hast been deceived,
True things hereafter will declare it to thee.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-49">But say if him I here behold, who forth
Evoked the new-invented rhymes, beginning,
'Ladies, that have intelligence of love?'"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-52">And I to him: "One am I, who, whenever
Love doth inspire me, note, and in that measure
Which he within me dictates, singing go."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-55">"O brother, now I see," he said, "the knot
Which me, the Notary, and Guittone held
Short of the sweet new style that now I hear.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-58">I do perceive full clearly how your pens
Go closely following after him who dictates,
Which with our own forsooth came not to pass;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-61">And he who sets himself to go beyond,
No difference sees from one style to another;"
And as if satisfied, he held his peace.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-64">Even as the birds, that winter tow'rds the Nile,
Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves,
Then fly in greater haste, and go in file;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-67">In such wise all the people who were there,
Turning their faces, hurried on their steps,
Both by their leanness and their wishes light.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-70">And as a man, who weary is with trotting,
Lets his companions onward go, and walks,
Until he vents the panting of his chest;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-73">So did Forese let the holy flock
Pass by, and came with me behind it, saying,
"When will it be that I again shall see thee?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-76">"How long," I answered, "I may live, I know not;
Yet my return will not so speedy be,
But I shall sooner in desire arrive;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-79">Because the place where I was set to live
From day to day of good is more depleted,
And unto dismal ruin seems ordained."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-82">"Now go," he said, "for him most guilty of it
At a beast's tail behold I dragged along
Towards the valley where is no repentance.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-85">Faster at every step the beast is going,
Increasing evermore until it smites him,
And leaves the body vilely mutilated.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-88">Not long those wheels shall turn," and he uplifted
His eyes to heaven, "ere shall be clear to thee
That which my speech no farther can declare.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-91">Now stay behind; because the time so precious
Is in this kingdom, that I lose too much
By coming onward thus abreast with thee."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-94">As sometimes issues forth upon a gallop
A cavalier from out a troop that ride,
And seeks the honour of the first encounter,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-97">So he with greater strides departed from us;
And on the road remained I with those two,
Who were such mighty marshals of the world.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-100">And when before us he had gone so far
Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants
As was my understanding to his words,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-103">Appeared to me with laden and living boughs
Another apple-tree, and not far distant,
From having but just then turned thitherward.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-106">People I saw beneath it lift their hands,
And cry I know not what towards the leaves,
Like little children eager and deluded,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-109">Who pray, and he they pray to doth not answer,
But, to make very keen their appetite,
Holds their desire aloft, and hides it not.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-112">Then they departed as if undeceived;
And now we came unto the mighty tree
Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-115">"Pass farther onward without drawing near;
The tree of which Eve ate is higher up,
And out of that one has this tree been raised."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-118">Thus said I know not who among the branches;
Whereat Virgilius, Statius, and myself
Went crowding forward on the side that rises.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-121">"Be mindful," said he, "of the accursed ones
Formed of the cloud-rack, who inebriate
Combated Theseus with their double breasts;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-124">And of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking,
Whence Gideon would not have them for companions
When he tow'rds Midian the hills descended."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-127">Thus, closely pressed to one of the two borders,
On passed we, hearing sins of gluttony,
Followed forsooth by miserable gains;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-130">Then set at large upon the lonely road,
A thousand steps and more we onward went,
In contemplation, each without a word.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-133">"What go ye thinking thus, ye three alone?"
Said suddenly a voice, whereat I started
As terrified and timid beasts are wont.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-136">I raised my head to see who this might be,
And never in a furnace was there seen
Metals or glass so lucent and so red
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-139">As one I saw who said: "If it may please you
To mount aloft, here it behoves you turn;
This way goes he who goeth after peace."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-142">His aspect had bereft me of my sight,
So that I turned me back unto my Teachers,
Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-145">And as, the harbinger of early dawn,
The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance,
Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-148">So did I feel a breeze strike in the midst
My front, and felt the moving of the plumes
That breathed around an odour of ambrosia;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-151">And heard it said: "Blessed are they whom grace
So much illumines, that the love of taste
Excites not in their breasts too great desire,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxiv-154">Hungering at all times so far as is just."
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XXV

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-1">Now was it the ascent no hindrance brooked,
Because the sun had his meridian circle
To Taurus left, and night to Scorpio;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-4">Wherefore as doth a man who tarries not,
But goes his way, whate'er to him appear,
If of necessity the sting transfix him,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-7">In this wise did we enter through the gap,
Taking the stairway, one before the other,
Which by its narrowness divides the climbers.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-10">And as the little stork that lifts its wing
With a desire to fly, and does not venture
To leave the nest, and lets it downward droop,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-13">Even such was I, with the desire of asking
Kindled and quenched, unto the motion coming
He makes who doth address himself to speak.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-16">Not for our pace, though rapid it might be,
My father sweet forbore, but said: "Let fly
The bow of speech thou to the barb hast drawn."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-19">With confidence I opened then my mouth,
And I began: "How can one meagre grow
There where the need of nutriment applies not?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-22">"If thou wouldst call to mind how Meleager
Was wasted by the wasting of a brand,
This would not," said he, "be to thee so sour;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-25">And wouldst thou think how at each tremulous motion
Trembles within a mirror your own image;
That which seems hard would mellow seem to thee.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-28">But that thou mayst content thee in thy wish
Lo Statius here; and him I call and pray
He now will be the healer of thy wounds."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-31">"If I unfold to him the eternal vengeance,"
Responded Statius, "where thou present art,
Be my excuse that I can naught deny thee."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-34">Then he began: "Son, if these words of mine
Thy mind doth contemplate and doth receive,
They'll be thy light unto the How thou sayest.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-37">The perfect blood, which never is drunk up
Into the thirsty veins, and which remaineth
Like food that from the table thou removest,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-40">Takes in the heart for all the human members
Virtue informative, as being that
Which to be changed to them goes through the veins
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-43">Again digest, descends it where 'tis better
Silent to be than say; and then drops thence
Upon another's blood in natural vase.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-46">There one together with the other mingles,
One to be passive meant, the other active
By reason of the perfect place it springs from;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-49">And being conjoined, begins to operate,
Coagulating first, then vivifying
What for its matter it had made consistent.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-52">The active virtue, being made a soul
As of a plant, (in so far different,
This on the way is, that arrived already,)
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-55">Then works so much, that now it moves and feels
Like a sea-fungus, and then undertakes
To organize the powers whose seed it is.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-58">Now, Son, dilates and now distends itself
The virtue from the generator's heart,
Where nature is intent on all the members.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-61">But how from animal it man becomes
Thou dost not see as yet; this is a point
Which made a wiser man than thou once err
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-64">So far, that in his doctrine separate
He made the soul from possible intellect,
For he no organ saw by this assumed.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-67">Open thy breast unto the truth that's coming,
And know that, just as soon as in the foetus
The articulation of the brain is perfect,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-70">The primal Motor turns to it well pleased
At so great art of nature, and inspires
A spirit new with virtue all replete,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-73">Which what it finds there active doth attract
Into its substance, and becomes one soul,
Which lives, and feels, and on itself revolves.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-76">And that thou less may wonder at my word,
Behold the sun's heat, which becometh wine,
Joined to the juice that from the vine distils.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-79">Whenever Lachesis has no more thread,
It separates from the flesh, and virtually
Bears with itself the human and divine;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-82">The other faculties are voiceless all;
The memory, the intelligence, and the will
In action far more vigorous than before.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-85">Without a pause it falleth of itself
In marvellous way on one shore or the other;
There of its roads it first is cognizant.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-88">Soon as the place there circumscribeth it,
The virtue informative rays round about,
As, and as much as, in the living members.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-91">And even as the air, when full of rain,
By alien rays that are therein reflected,
With divers colours shows itself adorned,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-94">So there the neighbouring air doth shape itself
Into that form which doth impress upon it
Virtually the soul that has stood still.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-97">And then in manner of the little flame,
Which followeth the fire where'er it shifts,
After the spirit followeth its new form.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-100">Since afterwards it takes from this its semblance,
It is called shade; and thence it organizes
Thereafter every sense, even to the sight.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-103">Thence is it that we speak, and thence we laugh;
Thence is it that we form the tears and sighs,
That on the mountain thou mayhap hast heard.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-106">According as impress us our desires
And other affections, so the shade is shaped,
And this is cause of what thou wonderest at."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-109">And now unto the last of all the circles
Had we arrived, and to the right hand turned,
And were attentive to another care.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-112">There the embankment shoots forth flames of fire,
And upward doth the cornice breathe a blast
That drives them back, and from itself sequesters.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-115">Hence we must needs go on the open side,
And one by one; and I did fear the fire
On this side, and on that the falling down.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-118">My Leader said: "Along this place one ought
To keep upon the eyes a tightened rein,
Seeing that one so easily might err."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-121">"Summae Deus clementiae," in the bosom
Of the great burning chanted then I heard,
Which made me no less eager to turn round;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-124">And spirits saw I walking through the flame;
Wherefore I looked, to my own steps and theirs
Apportioning my sight from time to time.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-127">After the close which to that hymn is made,
Aloud they shouted, "Virum non cognosco;"
Then recommenced the hymn with voices low.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-130">This also ended, cried they: "To the wood
Diana ran, and drove forth Helice
Therefrom, who had of Venus felt the poison."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-133">Then to their song returned they; then the wives
They shouted, and the husbands who were chaste.
As virtue and the marriage vow imposes.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-136">And I believe that them this mode suffices,
For all the time the fire is burning them;
With such care is it needful, and such food,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxv-139">That the last wound of all should be closed up.
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XXVI

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-1">While on the brink thus one before the other
We went upon our way, oft the good Master
Said: "Take thou heed! suffice it that I warn thee."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-4">On the right shoulder smote me now the sun,
That, raying out, already the whole west
Changed from its azure aspect into white.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-7">And with my shadow did I make the flame
Appear more red; and even to such a sign
Shades saw I many, as they went, give heed.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-10">This was the cause that gave them a beginning
To speak of me; and to themselves began they
To say: "That seems not a factitious body!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-13">Then towards me, as far as they could come,
Came certain of them, always with regard
Not to step forth where they would not be burned.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-16">"O thou who goest, not from being slower
But reverent perhaps, behind the others,
Answer me, who in thirst and fire am burning.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-19">Nor to me only is thine answer needful;
For all of these have greater thirst for it
Than for cold water Ethiop or Indian.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-22">Tell us how is it that thou makest thyself
A wall unto the sun, as if thou hadst not
Entered as yet into the net of death."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-25">Thus one of them addressed me, and I straight
Should have revealed myself, were I not bent
On other novelty that then appeared.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-28">For through the middle of the burning road
There came a people face to face with these,
Which held me in suspense with gazing at them.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-31">There see I hastening upon either side
Each of the shades, and kissing one another
Without a pause, content with brief salute.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-34">Thus in the middle of their brown battalions
Muzzle to muzzle one ant meets another
Perchance to spy their journey or their fortune.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-37">No sooner is the friendly greeting ended,
Or ever the first footstep passes onward,
Each one endeavours to outcry the other;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-40">The new-come people: "Sodom and Gomorrah!"
The rest: "Into the cow Pasiphae enters,
So that the bull unto her lust may run!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-43">Then as the cranes, that to Riphaean mountains
Might fly in part, and part towards the sands,
These of the frost, those of the sun avoidant,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-46">One folk is going, and the other coming,
And weeping they return to their first songs,
And to the cry that most befitteth them;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-49">And close to me approached, even as before,
The very same who had entreated me,
Attent to listen in their countenance.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-52">I, who their inclination twice had seen,
Began: "O souls secure in the possession,
Whene'er it may be, of a state of peace,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-55">Neither unripe nor ripened have remained
My members upon earth, but here are with me
With their own blood and their articulations.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-58">I go up here to be no longer blind;
A Lady is above, who wins this grace,
Whereby the mortal through your world I bring.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-61">But as your greatest longing satisfied
May soon become, so that the Heaven may house you
Which full of love is, and most amply spreads,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-64">Tell me, that I again in books may write it,
Who are you, and what is that multitude
Which goes upon its way behind your backs?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-67">Not otherwise with wonder is bewildered
The mountaineer, and staring round is dumb,
When rough and rustic to the town he goes,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-70">Than every shade became in its appearance;
But when they of their stupor were disburdened,
Which in high hearts is quickly quieted,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-73">"Blessed be thou, who of our border-lands,"
He recommenced who first had questioned us,
"Experience freightest for a better life.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-76">The folk that comes not with us have offended
In that for which once Caesar, triumphing,
Heard himself called in contumely, 'Queen.'
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-79">Therefore they separate, exclaiming, 'Sodom!'
Themselves reproving, even as thou hast heard,
And add unto their burning by their shame.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-82">Our own transgression was hermaphrodite;
But because we observed not human law,
Following like unto beasts our appetite,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-85">In our opprobrium by us is read,
When we part company, the name of her
Who bestialized herself in bestial wood.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-88">Now knowest thou our acts, and what our crime was;
Wouldst thou perchance by name know who we are,
There is not time to tell, nor could I do it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-91">Thy wish to know me shall in sooth be granted;
I'm Guido Guinicelli, and now purge me,
Having repented ere the hour extreme."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-94">The same that in the sadness of Lycurgus
Two sons became, their mother re-beholding,
Such I became, but rise not to such height,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-97">The moment I heard name himself the father
Of me and of my betters, who had ever
Practised the sweet and gracious rhymes of love;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-100">And without speech and hearing thoughtfully
For a long time I went, beholding him,
Nor for the fire did I approach him nearer.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-103">When I was fed with looking, utterly
Myself I offered ready for his service,
With affirmation that compels belief.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-106">And he to me: "Thou leavest footprints such
In me, from what I hear, and so distinct,
Lethe cannot efface them, nor make dim.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-109">But if thy words just now the truth have sworn,
Tell me what is the cause why thou displayest
In word and look that dear thou holdest me?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-112">And I to him: "Those dulcet lays of yours
Which, long as shall endure our modern fashion,
Shall make for ever dear their very ink!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-115">"O brother," said he, "he whom I point out,"
And here he pointed at a spirit in front,
"Was of the mother tongue a better smith.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-118">Verses of love and proses of romance,
He mastered all; and let the idiots talk,
Who think the Lemosin surpasses him.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-121">To clamour more than truth they turn their faces,
And in this way establish their opinion,
Ere art or reason has by them been heard.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-124">Thus many ancients with Guittone did,
From cry to cry still giving him applause,
Until the truth has conquered with most persons.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-127">Now, if thou hast such ample privilege
'Tis granted thee to go unto the cloister
Wherein is Christ the abbot of the college,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-130">To him repeat for me a Paternoster,
So far as needful to us of this world,
Where power of sinning is no longer ours."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-133">Then, to give place perchance to one behind,
Whom he had near, he vanished in the fire
As fish in water going to the bottom.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-136">I moved a little tow'rds him pointed out,
And said that to his name my own desire
An honourable place was making ready.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-139">He of his own free will began to say:
'Tan m' abellis vostre cortes deman,
Que jeu nom' puesc ni vueill a vos cobrire;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-142">Jeu sui Arnaut, que plor e vai chantan;
Consiros vei la passada folor,
E vei jauzen lo jorn qu' esper denan.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-145">Ara vus prec per aquella valor,
Que vus condus al som de la scalina,
Sovenga vus a temprar ma dolor.'*
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvi-148">Then hid him in the fire that purifies them.
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XXVII

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-1">As when he vibrates forth his earliest rays,
In regions where his Maker shed his blood,
(The Ebro falling under lofty Libra,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-4">And waters in the Ganges burnt with noon,)
So stood the Sun; hence was the day departing,
When the glad Angel of God appeared to us.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-7">Outside the flame he stood upon the verge,
And chanted forth, "Beati mundo corde,"
In voice by far more living than our own.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-10">Then: "No one farther goes, souls sanctified,
If first the fire bite not; within it enter,
And be not deaf unto the song beyond."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-13">When we were close beside him thus he said;
Wherefore e'en such became I, when I heard him,
As he is who is put into the grave.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-16">Upon my clasped hands I straightened me,
Scanning the fire, and vividly recalling
The human bodies I had once seen burned.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-19">Towards me turned themselves my good Conductors,
And unto me Virgilius said: "My son,
Here may indeed be torment, but not death.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-22">Remember thee, remember! and if I
On Geryon have safely guided thee,
What shall I do now I am nearer God?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-25">Believe for certain, shouldst thou stand a full
Millennium in the bosom of this flame,
It could not make thee bald a single hair.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-28">And if perchance thou think that I deceive thee,
Draw near to it, and put it to the proof
With thine own hands upon thy garment's hem.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-31">Now lay aside, now lay aside all fear,
Turn hitherward, and onward come securely;"
And I still motionless, and 'gainst my conscience!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-34">Seeing me stand still motionless and stubborn,
Somewhat disturbed he said: "Now look thou, Son,
'Twixt Beatrice and thee there is this wall."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-37">As at the name of Thisbe oped his lids
The dying Pyramus, and gazed upon her,
What time the mulberry became vermilion,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-40">Even thus, my obduracy being softened,
I turned to my wise Guide, hearing the name
That in my memory evermore is welling.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-43">Whereat he wagged his head, and said: "How now?
Shall we stay on this side?" then smiled as one
Does at a child who's vanquished by an apple.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-46">Then into the fire in front of me he entered,
Beseeching Statius to come after me,
Who a long way before divided us.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-49">When I was in it, into molten glass
I would have cast me to refresh myself,
So without measure was the burning there!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-52">And my sweet Father, to encourage me,
Discoursing still of Beatrice went on,
Saying: "Her eyes I seem to see already!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-55">A voice, that on the other side was singing,
Directed us, and we, attent alone
On that, came forth where the ascent began.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-58">"Venite, benedicti Patris mei,"
Sounded within a splendour, which was there
Such it o'ercame me, and I could not look.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-61">"The sun departs," it added, "and night cometh;
Tarry ye not, but onward urge your steps,
So long as yet the west becomes not dark."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-64">Straight forward through the rock the path ascended
In such a way that I cut off the rays
Before me of the sun, that now was low.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-67">And of few stairs we yet had made assay,
Ere by the vanished shadow the sun's setting
Behind us we perceived, I and my Sages.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-70">And ere in all its parts immeasurable
The horizon of one aspect had become,
And Night her boundless dispensation held,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-73">Each of us of a stair had made his bed;
Because the nature of the mount took from us
The power of climbing, more than the delight.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-76">Even as in ruminating passive grow
The goats, who have been swift and venturesome
Upon the mountain-tops ere they were fed,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-79">Hushed in the shadow, while the sun is hot,
Watched by the herdsman, who upon his staff
Is leaning, and in leaning tendeth them;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-82">And as the shepherd, lodging out of doors,
Passes the night beside his quiet flock,
Watching that no wild beast may scatter it,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-85">Such at that hour were we, all three of us,
I like the goat, and like the herdsmen they,
Begirt on this side and on that by rocks.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-88">Little could there be seen of things without;
But through that little I beheld the stars
More luminous and larger than their wont.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-91">Thus ruminating, and beholding these,
Sleep seized upon me,--sleep, that oftentimes
Before a deed is done has tidings of it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-94">It was the hour, I think, when from the East
First on the mountain Citherea beamed,
Who with the fire of love seems always burning;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-97">Youthful and beautiful in dreams methought
I saw a lady walking in a meadow,
Gathering flowers; and singing she was saying:
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-100">"Know whosoever may my name demand
That I am Leah, and go moving round
My beauteous hands to make myself a garland.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-103">To please me at the mirror, here I deck me,
But never does my sister Rachel leave
Her looking-glass, and sitteth all day long.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-106">To see her beauteous eyes as eager is she,
As I am to adorn me with my hands;
Her, seeing, and me, doing satisfies."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-109">And now before the antelucan splendours
That unto pilgrims the more grateful rise,
As, home-returning, less remote they lodge,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-112">The darkness fled away on every side,
And slumber with it; whereupon I rose,
Seeing already the great Masters risen.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-115">"That apple sweet, which through so many branches
The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of,
To-day shall put in peace thy hungerings."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-118">Speaking to me, Virgilius of such words
As these made use; and never were there guerdons
That could in pleasantness compare with these.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-121">Such longing upon longing came upon me
To be above, that at each step thereafter
For flight I felt in me the pinions growing.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-124">When underneath us was the stairway all
Run o'er, and we were on the highest step,
Virgilius fastened upon me his eyes,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-127">And said: "The temporal fire and the eternal,
Son, thou hast seen, and to a place art come
Where of myself no farther I discern.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-130">By intellect and art I here have brought thee;
Take thine own pleasure for thy guide henceforth;
Beyond the steep ways and the narrow art thou.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-133">Behold the sun, that shines upon thy forehead;
Behold the grass, the flowerets, and the shrubs
Which of itself alone this land produces.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-136">Until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes
Which weeping caused me to come unto thee,
Thou canst sit down, and thou canst walk among them.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-139">Expect no more or word or sign from me;
Free and upright and sound is thy free-will,
And error were it not to do its bidding;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxvii-142">Thee o'er thyself I therefore crown and mitre!"
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XXVIII

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-1">Eager already to search in and round
The heavenly forest, dense and living-green,
Which tempered to the eyes the new-born day,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-4">Withouten more delay I left the bank,
Taking the level country slowly, slowly
Over the soil that everywhere breathes fragrance.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-7">A softly-breathing air, that no mutation
Had in itself, upon the forehead smote me
No heavier blow than of a gentle wind,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-10">Whereat the branches, lightly tremulous,
Did all of them bow downward toward that side
Where its first shadow casts the Holy Mountain;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-13">Yet not from their upright direction swayed,
So that the little birds upon their tops
Should leave the practice of each art of theirs;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-16">But with full ravishment the hours of prime,
Singing, received they in the midst of leaves,
That ever bore a burden to their rhymes,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-19">Such as from branch to branch goes gathering on
Through the pine forest on the shore of Chiassi,
When Eolus unlooses the Sirocco.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-22">Already my slow steps had carried me
Into the ancient wood so far, that I
Could not perceive where I had entered it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-25">And lo! my further course a stream cut off,
Which tow'rd the left hand with its little waves
Bent down the grass that on its margin sprang.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-28">All waters that on earth most limpid are
Would seem to have within themselves some mixture
Compared with that which nothing doth conceal,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-31">Although it moves on with a brown, brown current
Under the shade perpetual, that never
Ray of the sun lets in, nor of the moon.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-34">With feet I stayed, and with mine eyes I passed
Beyond the rivulet, to look upon
The great variety of the fresh may.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-37">And there appeared to me (even as appears
Suddenly something that doth turn aside
Through very wonder every other thought)
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-40">A lady all alone, who went along
Singing and culling floweret after floweret,
With which her pathway was all painted over.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-43">"Ah, beauteous lady, who in rays of love
Dost warm thyself, if I may trust to looks,
Which the heart's witnesses are wont to be,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-46">May the desire come unto thee to draw
Near to this river's bank," I said to her,
"So much that I might hear what thou art singing.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-49">Thou makest me remember where and what
Proserpina that moment was when lost
Her mother her, and she herself the Spring."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-52">As turns herself, with feet together pressed
And to the ground, a lady who is dancing,
And hardly puts one foot before the other,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-55">On the vermilion and the yellow flowerets
She turned towards me, not in other wise
Than maiden who her modest eyes casts down;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-58">And my entreaties made to be content,
So near approaching, that the dulcet sound
Came unto me together with its meaning
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-61">As soon as she was where the grasses are.
Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river,
To lift her eyes she granted me the boon.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-64">I do not think there shone so great a light
Under the lids of Venus, when transfixed
By her own son, beyond his usual custom!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-67">Erect upon the other bank she smiled,
Bearing full many colours in her hands,
Which that high land produces without seed.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-70">Apart three paces did the river make us;
But Hellespont, where Xerxes passed across,
(A curb still to all human arrogance,)
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-73">More hatred from Leander did not suffer
For rolling between Sestos and Abydos,
Than that from me, because it oped not then.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-76">"Ye are new-comers; and because I smile,"
Began she, "peradventure, in this place
Elect to human nature for its nest,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-79">Some apprehension keeps you marvelling;
But the psalm 'Delectasti' giveth light
Which has the power to uncloud your intellect.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-82">And thou who foremost art, and didst entreat me,
Speak, if thou wouldst hear more; for I came ready
To all thy questionings, as far as needful."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-85">"The water," said I, "and the forest's sound,
Are combating within me my new faith
In something which I heard opposed to this."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-88">Whence she: "I will relate how from its cause
Proceedeth that which maketh thee to wonder,
And purge away the cloud that smites upon thee.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-91">The Good Supreme, sole in itself delighting,
Created man good, and this goodly place
Gave him as hansel of eternal peace.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-94">By his default short while he sojourned here;
By his default to weeping and to toil
He changed his innocent laughter and sweet play.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-97">That the disturbance which below is made
By exhalations of the land and water,
(Which far as may be follow after heat,)
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-100">Might not upon mankind wage any war,
This mount ascended tow'rds the heaven so high,
And is exempt, from there where it is locked.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-103">Now since the universal atmosphere
Turns in a circuit with the primal motion
Unless the circle is broken on some side,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-106">Upon this height, that all is disengaged
In living ether, doth this motion strike
And make the forest sound, for it is dense;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-109">And so much power the stricken plant possesses
That with its virtue it impregns the air,
And this, revolving, scatters it around;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-112">And yonder earth, according as 'tis worthy
In self or in its clime, conceives and bears
Of divers qualities the divers trees;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-115">It should not seem a marvel then on earth,
This being heard, whenever any plant
Without seed manifest there taketh root.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-118">And thou must know, this holy table-land
In which thou art is full of every seed,
And fruit has in it never gathered there.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-121">The water which thou seest springs not from vein
Restored by vapour that the cold condenses,
Like to a stream that gains or loses breath;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-124">But issues from a fountain safe and certain,
Which by the will of God as much regains
As it discharges, open on two sides.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-127">Upon this side with virtue it descends,
Which takes away all memory of sin;
On that, of every good deed done restores it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-130">Here Lethe, as upon the other side
Eunoe, it is called; and worketh not
If first on either side it be not tasted.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-133">This every other savour doth transcend;
And notwithstanding slaked so far may be
Thy thirst, that I reveal to thee no more,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-136">I'll give thee a corollary still in grace,
Nor think my speech will be to thee less dear
If it spread out beyond my promise to thee.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-139">Those who in ancient times have feigned in song
The Age of Gold and its felicity,
Dreamed of this place perhaps upon Parnassus.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-142">Here was the human race in innocence;
Here evermore was Spring, and every fruit;
This is the nectar of which each one speaks."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-145">Then backward did I turn me wholly round
Unto my Poets, and saw that with a smile
They had been listening to these closing words;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxviii-148">Then to the beautiful lady turned mine eyes.
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XXIX

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-1">Singing like unto an enamoured lady
She, with the ending of her words, continued:
"Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-4">And even as Nymphs, that wandered all alone
Among the sylvan shadows, sedulous
One to avoid and one to see the sun,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-7">She then against the stream moved onward, going
Along the bank, and I abreast of her,
Her little steps with little steps attending.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-10">Between her steps and mine were not a hundred,
When equally the margins gave a turn,
In such a way, that to the East I faced.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-13">Nor even thus our way continued far
Before the lady wholly turned herself
Unto me, saying, "Brother, look and listen!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-16">And lo! a sudden lustre ran across
On every side athwart the spacious forest,
Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-19">But since the lightning ceases as it comes,
And that continuing brightened more and more,
Within my thought I said, "What thing is this?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-22">And a delicious melody there ran
Along the luminous air, whence holy zeal
Made me rebuke the hardihood of Eve;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-25">For there where earth and heaven obedient were,
The woman only, and but just created,
Could not endure to stay 'neath any veil;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-28">Underneath which had she devoutly stayed,
I sooner should have tasted those delights
Ineffable, and for a longer time.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-31">While 'mid such manifold first-fruits I walked
Of the eternal pleasure all enrapt,
And still solicitous of more delights,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-34">In front of us like an enkindled fire
Became the air beneath the verdant boughs,
And the sweet sound as singing now was heard.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-37">O Virgins sacrosanct! if ever hunger,
Vigils, or cold for you I have endured,
The occasion spurs me their reward to claim!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-40">Now Helicon must needs pour forth for me,
And with her choir Urania must assist me,
To put in verse things difficult to think.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-43">A little farther on, seven trees of gold
In semblance the long space still intervening
Between ourselves and them did counterfeit;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-46">But when I had approached so near to them
The common object, which the sense deceives,
Lost not by distance any of its marks,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-49">The faculty that lends discourse to reason
Did apprehend that they were candlesticks,
And in the voices of the song "Hosanna!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-52">Above them flamed the harness beautiful,
Far brighter than the moon in the serene
Of midnight, at the middle of her month.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-55">I turned me round, with admiration filled,
To good Virgilius, and he answered me
With visage no less full of wonderment.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-58">Then back I turned my face to those high things,
Which moved themselves towards us so sedately,
They had been distanced by new-wedded brides.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-61">The lady chid me: "Why dost thou burn only
So with affection for the living lights,
And dost not look at what comes after them?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-64">Then saw I people, as behind their leaders,
Coming behind them, garmented in white,
And such a whiteness never was on earth.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-67">The water on my left flank was resplendent,
And back to me reflected my left side,
E'en as a mirror, if I looked therein.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-70">When I upon my margin had such post
That nothing but the stream divided us,
Better to see I gave my steps repose;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-73">And I beheld the flamelets onward go,
Leaving behind themselves the air depicted,
And they of trailing pennons had the semblance,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-76">So that it overhead remained distinct
With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colours
Whence the sun's bow is made, and Delia's girdle.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-79">These standards to the rearward longer were
Than was my sight; and, as it seemed to me,
Ten paces were the outermost apart.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-82">Under so fair a heaven as I describe
The four and twenty Elders, two by two,
Came on incoronate with flower-de-luce.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-85">They all of them were singing: "Blessed thou
Among the daughters of Adam art, and blessed
For evermore shall be thy loveliness."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-88">After the flowers and other tender grasses
In front of me upon the other margin
Were disencumbered of that race elect,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-91">Even as in heaven star followeth after star,
There came close after them four animals,
Incoronate each one with verdant leaf.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-94">Plumed with six wings was every one of them,
The plumage full of eyes; the eyes of Argus
If they were living would be such as these.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-97">Reader! to trace their forms no more I waste
My rhymes; for other spendings press me so,
That I in this cannot be prodigal.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-100">But read Ezekiel, who depicteth them
As he beheld them from the region cold
Coming with cloud, with whirlwind, and with fire;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-103">And such as thou shalt find them in his pages,
Such were they here; saving that in their plumage
John is with me, and differeth from him.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-106">The interval between these four contained
A chariot triumphal on two wheels,
Which by a Griffin's neck came drawn along;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-109">And upward he extended both his wings
Between the middle list and three and three,
So that he injured none by cleaving it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-112">So high they rose that they were lost to sight;
His limbs were gold, so far as he was bird,
And white the others with vermilion mingled.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-115">Not only Rome with no such splendid car
E'er gladdened Africanus, or Augustus,
But poor to it that of the Sun would be,--
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-118">That of the Sun, which swerving was burnt up
At the importunate orison of Earth,
When Jove was so mysteriously just.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-121">Three maidens at the right wheel in a circle
Came onward dancing; one so very red
That in the fire she hardly had been noted.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-124">The second was as if her flesh and bones
Had all been fashioned out of emerald;
The third appeared as snow but newly fallen.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-127">And now they seemed conducted by the white,
Now by the red, and from the song of her
The others took their step, or slow or swift.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-130">Upon the left hand four made holiday
Vested in purple, following the measure
Of one of them with three eyes m her head.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-133">In rear of all the group here treated of
Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit,
But like in gait, each dignified and grave.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-136">One showed himself as one of the disciples
Of that supreme Hippocrates, whom nature
Made for the animals she holds most dear;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-139">Contrary care the other manifested,
With sword so shining and so sharp, it caused
Terror to me on this side of the river.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-142">Thereafter four I saw of humble aspect,
And behind all an aged man alone
Walking in sleep with countenance acute.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-145">And like the foremost company these seven
Were habited; yet of the flower-de-luce
No garland round about the head they wore,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-148">But of the rose, and other flowers vermilion;
At little distance would the sight have sworn
That all were in a flame above their brows.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-151">And when the car was opposite to me
Thunder was heard; and all that folk august
Seemed to have further progress interdicted,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxix-154">There with the vanward ensigns standing still.
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XXX

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-1">When the Septentrion of the highest heaven
(Which never either setting knew or rising,
Nor veil of other cloud than that of sin,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-4">And which made every one therein aware
Of his own duty, as the lower makes
Whoever turns the helm to come to port)
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-7">Motionless halted, the veracious people,
That came at first between it and the Griffin,
Turned themselves to the car, as to their peace.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-10">And one of them, as if by Heaven commissioned,
Singing, "Veni, sponsa, de Libano"
Shouted three times, and all the others after.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-13">Even as the Blessed at the final summons
Shall rise up quickened each one from his cavern,
Uplifting light the reinvested flesh,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-16">So upon that celestial chariot
A hundred rose 'ad vocem tanti senis,'
Ministers and messengers of life eternal.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-19">They all were saying, "Benedictus qui venis,"
And, scattering flowers above and round about,
"Manibus o date lilia plenis."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-22">Ere now have I beheld, as day began,
The eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose,
And the other heaven with fair serene adorned;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-25">And the sun's face, uprising, overshadowed
So that by tempering influence of vapours
For a long interval the eye sustained it;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-28">Thus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers
Which from those hands angelical ascended,
And downward fell again inside and out,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-31">Over her snow-white veil with olive cinct
Appeared a lady under a green mantle,
Vested in colour of the living flame.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-34">And my own spirit, that already now
So long a time had been, that in her presence
Trembling with awe it had not stood abashed,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-37">Without more knowledge having by mine eyes,
Through occult virtue that from her proceeded
Of ancient love the mighty influence felt.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-40">As soon as on my vision smote the power
Sublime, that had already pierced me through
Ere from my boyhood I had yet come forth,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-43">To the left hand I turned with that reliance
With which the little child runs to his mother,
When he has fear, or when he is afflicted,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-46">To say unto Virgilius: "Not a drachm
Of blood remains in me, that does not tremble;
I know the traces of the ancient flame."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-49">But us Virgilius of himself deprived
Had left, Virgilius, sweetest of all fathers,
Virgilius, to whom I for safety gave me:
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-52">Nor whatsoever lost the ancient mother
Availed my cheeks now purified from dew,
That weeping they should not again be darkened.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-55">"Dante, because Virgilius has departed
Do not weep yet, do not weep yet awhile;
For by another sword thou need'st must weep."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-58">E'en as an admiral, who on poop and prow
Comes to behold the people that are working
In other ships, and cheers them to well-doing,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-61">Upon the left hand border of the car,
When at the sound I turned of my own name,
Which of necessity is here recorded,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-64">I saw the Lady, who erewhile appeared
Veiled underneath the angelic festival,
Direct her eyes to me across the river.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-67">Although the veil, that from her head descended,
Encircled with the foliage of Minerva,
Did not permit her to appear distinctly,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-70">In attitude still royally majestic
Continued she, like unto one who speaks,
And keeps his warmest utterance in reserve:
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-73">"Look at me well; in sooth I'm Beatrice!
How didst thou deign to come unto the Mountain?
Didst thou not know that man is happy here?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-76">Mine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain,
But, seeing myself therein, I sought the grass,
So great a shame did weigh my forehead down.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-79">As to the son the mother seems superb,
So she appeared to me; for somewhat bitter
Tasteth the savour of severe compassion.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-82">Silent became she, and the Angels sang
Suddenly, "In te, Domine, speravi:"
But beyond 'pedes meos' did not pass.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-85">Even as the snow among the living rafters
Upon the back of Italy congeals,
Blown on and drifted by Sclavonian winds,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-88">And then, dissolving, trickles through itself
Whene'er the land that loses shadow breathes,
So that it seems a fire that melts a taper;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-91">E'en thus was I without a tear or sigh,
Before the song of those who sing for ever
After the music of the eternal spheres.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-94">But when I heard in their sweet melodies
Compassion for me, more than had they said,
"O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-97">The ice, that was about my heart congealed,
To air and water changed, and in my anguish
Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-100">She, on the right-hand border of the car
Still firmly standing, to those holy beings
Thus her discourse directed afterwards:
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-103">"Ye keep your watch in the eternal day,
So that nor night nor sleep can steal from you
One step the ages make upon their path;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-106">Therefore my answer is with greater care,
That he may hear me who is weeping yonder,
So that the sin and dole be of one measure.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-109">Not only by the work of those great wheels,
That destine every seed unto some end,
According as the stars are in conjunction,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-112">But by the largess of celestial graces,
Which have such lofty vapours for their rain
That near to them our sight approaches not,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-115">Such had this man become in his new life
Potentially, that every righteous habit
Would have made admirable proof in him;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-118">But so much more malignant and more savage
Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed,
The more good earthly vigour it possesses.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-121">Some time did I sustain him with my look;
Revealing unto him my youthful eyes,
I led him with me turned in the right way.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-124">As soon as ever of my second age
I was upon the threshold and changed life,
Himself from me he took and gave to others.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-127">When from the flesh to spirit I ascended,
And beauty and virtue were in me increased,
I was to him less dear and less delightful;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-130">And into ways untrue he turned his steps,
Pursuing the false images of good,
That never any promises fulfil;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-133">Nor prayer for inspiration me availed,
By means of which in dreams and otherwise
I called him back, so little did he heed them.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-136">So low he fell, that all appliances
For his salvation were already short,
Save showing him the people of perdition.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-139">For this I visited the gates of death,
And unto him, who so far up has led him,
My intercessions were with weeping borne.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-142">God's lofty fiat would be violated,
If Lethe should be passed, and if such viands
Should tasted be, withouten any scot
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxx-145">Of penitence, that gushes forth in tears."
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XXXI

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-1">"O thou who art beyond the sacred river,"
Turning to me the point of her discourse,
That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-4">She recommenced, continuing without pause,
"Say, say if this be true; to such a charge,
Thy own confession needs must be conjoined."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-7">My faculties were in so great confusion,
That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct
Than by its organs it was set at large.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-10">Awhile she waited; then she said: "What thinkest?
Answer me; for the mournful memories
In thee not yet are by the waters injured."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-13">Confusion and dismay together mingled
Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight
Was needful to the understanding of it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-16">Even as a cross-bow breaks, when 'tis discharged
Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow,
And with less force the arrow hits the mark,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-19">So I gave way beneath that heavy burden,
Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs,
And the voice flagged upon its passage forth.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-22">Whence she to me: "In those desires of mine
Which led thee to the loving of that good,
Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-25">What trenches lying traverse or what chains
Didst thou discover, that of passing onward
Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-28">And what allurements or what vantages
Upon the forehead of the others showed,
That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-31">After the heaving of a bitter sigh,
Hardly had I the voice to make response,
And with fatigue my lips did fashion it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-34">Weeping I said: "The things that present were
With their false pleasure turned aside my steps,
Soon as your countenance concealed itself."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-37">And she: "Shouldst thou be silent, or deny
What thou confessest, not less manifest
Would be thy fault, by such a Judge 'tis known.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-40">But when from one's own cheeks comes bursting forth
The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal
Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-43">But still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame
For thy transgression, and another time
Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-46">Cast down the seed of weeping and attend;
So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way
My buried flesh should have directed thee.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-49">Never to thee presented art or nature
Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein
I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-52">And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee
By reason of my death, what mortal thing
Should then have drawn thee into its desire?
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-55">Thou oughtest verily at the first shaft
Of things fallacious to have risen up
To follow me, who was no longer such.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-58">Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward
To wait for further blows, or little girl,
Or other vanity of such brief use.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-61">The callow birdlet waits for two or three,
But to the eyes of those already fledged,
In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-64">Even as children silent in their shame
Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground,
And conscious of their fault, and penitent;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-67">So was I standing; and she said: "If thou
In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard
And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-70">With less resistance is a robust holm
Uprooted, either by a native wind
Or else by that from regions of Iarbas,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-73">Than I upraised at her command my chin;
And when she by the beard the face demanded,
Well I perceived the venom of her meaning.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-76">And as my countenance was lifted up,
Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful
Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-79">And, still but little reassured, mine eyes
Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster,
That is one person only in two natures.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-82">Beneath her veil, beyond the margent green,
She seemed to me far more her ancient self
To excel, than others here, when she was here.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-85">So pricked me then the thorn of penitence,
That of all other things the one which turned me
Most to its love became the most my foe.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-88">Such self-conviction stung me at the heart
O'erpowered I fell, and what I then became
She knoweth who had furnished me the cause.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-91">Then, when the heart restored my outward sense,
The lady I had found alone, above me
I saw, and she was saying, "Hold me, hold me."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-94">Up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me,
And, dragging me behind her, she was moving
Upon the water lightly as a shuttle.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-97">When I was near unto the blessed shore,
"Asperges me," I heard so sweetly sung,
Remember it I cannot, much less write it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-100">The beautiful lady opened wide her arms,
Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath,
Where I was forced to swallow of the water.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-103">Then forth she drew me, and all dripping brought
Into the dance of the four beautiful,
And each one with her arm did cover me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-106">'We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars;
Ere Beatrice descended to the world,
We as her handmaids were appointed her.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-109">We'll lead thee to her eyes; but for the pleasant
Light that within them is, shall sharpen thine
The three beyond, who more profoundly look.'
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-112">Thus singing they began; and afterwards
Unto the Griffin's breast they led me with them,
Where Beatrice was standing, turned towards us.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-115">"See that thou dost not spare thine eyes," they said;
"Before the emeralds have we stationed thee,
Whence Love aforetime drew for thee his weapons."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-118">A thousand longings, hotter than the flame,
Fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent,
That still upon the Griffin steadfast stayed.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-121">As in a glass the sun, not otherwise
Within them was the twofold monster shining,
Now with the one, now with the other nature.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-124">Think, Reader, if within myself I marvelled,
When I beheld the thing itself stand still,
And in its image it transformed itself.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-127">While with amazement filled and jubilant,
My soul was tasting of the food, that while
It satisfies us makes us hunger for it,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-130">Themselves revealing of the highest rank
In bearing, did the other three advance,
Singing to their angelic saraband.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-133">"Turn, Beatrice, O turn thy holy eyes,"
Such was their song, "unto thy faithful one,
Who has to see thee ta'en so many steps.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-136">In grace do us the grace that thou unveil
Thy face to him, so that he may discern
The second beauty which thou dost conceal."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-139">O splendour of the living light eternal!
Who underneath the shadow of Parnassus
Has grown so pale, or drunk so at its cistern,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-142">He would not seem to have his mind encumbered
Striving to paint thee as thou didst appear,
Where the harmonious heaven o'ershadowed thee,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxi-145">When in the open air thou didst unveil?
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XXXII

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-1">So steadfast and attentive were mine eyes
In satisfying their decennial thirst,
That all my other senses were extinct,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-4">And upon this side and on that they had
Walls of indifference, so the holy smile
Drew them unto itself with the old net
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-7">When forcibly my sight was turned away
Towards my left hand by those goddesses,
Because I heard from them a "Too intently!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-10">And that condition of the sight which is
In eyes but lately smitten by the sun
Bereft me of my vision some short while;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-13">But to the less when sight re-shaped itself,
I say the less in reference to the greater
Splendour from which perforce I had withdrawn,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-16">I saw upon its right wing wheeled about
The glorious host returning with the sun
And with the sevenfold flames upon their faces.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-19">As underneath its shields, to save itself,
A squadron turns, and with its banner wheels,
Before the whole thereof can change its front,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-22">That soldiery of the celestial kingdom
Which marched in the advance had wholly passed us
Before the chariot had turned its pole.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-25">Then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves,
And the Griffin moved his burden benedight,
But so that not a feather of him fluttered.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-28">The lady fair who drew me through the ford
Followed with Statius and myself the wheel
Which made its orbit with the lesser arc.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-31">So passing through the lofty forest, vacant
By fault of her who in the serpent trusted,
Angelic music made our steps keep time.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-34">Perchance as great a space had in three flights
An arrow loosened from the string o'erpassed,
As we had moved when Beatrice descended.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-37">I heard them murmur altogether, "Adam!"
Then circled they about a tree despoiled
Of blooms and other leafage on each bough.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-40">Its tresses, which so much the more dilate
As higher they ascend, had been by Indians
Among their forests marvelled at for height.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-43">"Blessed art thou, O Griffin, who dost not
Pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste,
Since appetite by this was turned to evil."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-46">After this fashion round the tree robust
The others shouted; and the twofold creature:
"Thus is preserved the seed of all the just."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-49">And turning to the pole which he had dragged,
He drew it close beneath the widowed bough,
And what was of it unto it left bound.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-52">In the same manner as our trees (when downward
Falls the great light, with that together mingled
Which after the celestial Lasca shines)
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-55">Begin to swell, and then renew themselves,
Each one with its own colour, ere the Sun
Harness his steeds beneath another star:
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-58">Less than of rose and more than violet
A hue disclosing, was renewed the tree
That had erewhile its boughs so desolate.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-61">I never heard, nor here below is sung,
The hymn which afterward that people sang,
Nor did I bear the melody throughout.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-64">Had I the power to paint how fell asleep
Those eyes compassionless, of Syrinx hearing,
Those eyes to which more watching cost so dear,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-67">Even as a painter who from model paints
I would portray how I was lulled asleep;
He may, who well can picture drowsihood.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-70">Therefore I pass to what time I awoke,
And say a splendour rent from me the veil
Of slumber, and a calling: "Rise, what dost thou?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-73">As to behold the apple-tree in blossom
Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit,
And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-76">Peter and John and James conducted were,
And, overcome, recovered at the word
By which still greater slumbers have been broken,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-79">And saw their school diminished by the loss
Not only of Elias, but of Moses,
And the apparel of their Master changed;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-82">So I revived, and saw that piteous one
Above me standing, who had been conductress
Aforetime of my steps beside the river,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-85">And all in doubt I said, "Where's Beatrice?"
And she: "Behold her seated underneath
The leafage new, upon the root of it.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-88">Behold the company that circles her;
The rest behind the Griffin are ascending
With more melodious song, and more profound."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-91">And if her speech were more diffuse I know not,
Because already in my sight was she
Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-94">Alone she sat upon the very earth,
Left there as guardian of the chariot
Which I had seen the biform monster fasten.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-97">Encircling her, a cloister made themselves
The seven Nymphs, with those lights in their hands
Which are secure from Aquilon and Auster.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-100">"Short while shalt thou be here a forester,
And thou shalt be with me for evermore
A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-103">Therefore, for that world's good which liveth ill,
Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest,
Having returned to earth, take heed thou write."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-106">Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet
Of her commandments all devoted was,
My mind and eyes directed where she willed.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-109">Never descended with so swift a motion
Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining
From out the region which is most remote,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-112">As I beheld the bird of Jove descend
Down through the tree, rending away the bark,
As well as blossoms and the foliage new,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-115">And he with all his might the chariot smote,
Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest
Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-118">Thereafter saw I leap into the body
Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox,
That seemed unfed with any wholesome food.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-121">But for his hideous sins upbraiding him,
My Lady put him to as swift a flight
As such a fleshless skeleton could bear.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-124">Then by the way that it before had come,
Into the chariot's chest I saw the Eagle
Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-127">And such as issues from a heart that mourns,
A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said:
"My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-130">Methought, then, that the earth did yawn between
Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon,
Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-133">And as a wasp that draweth back its sting,
Drawing unto himself his tail malign,
Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-136">That which remained behind, even as with grass
A fertile region, with the feathers, offered
Perhaps with pure intention and benign,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-139">Reclothed itself, and with them were reclothed
The pole and both the wheels so speedily,
A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-142">Transfigured thus the holy edifice
Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it,
Three on the pole and one at either corner.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-145">The first were horned like oxen; but the four
Had but a single horn upon the forehead;
A monster such had never yet been seen!
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-148">Firm as a rock upon a mountain high,
Seated upon it, there appeared to me
A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-151">And, as if not to have her taken from him,
Upright beside her I beheld a giant;
And ever and anon they kissed each other.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-154">But because she her wanton, roving eye
Turned upon me, her angry paramour
Did scourge her from her head unto her feet.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-157">Then full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath,
He loosed the monster, and across the forest
Dragged it so far, he made of that alone
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxii-160">A shield unto the whore and the strange beast.
</p>

## Purgatorio - Canto XXXIII

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-1">"Deus venerunt gentes," alternating
Now three, now four, melodious psalmody
The maidens in the midst of tears began;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-4">And Beatrice, compassionate and sighing,
Listened to them with such a countenance,
That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-7">But when the other virgins place had given
For her to speak, uprisen to her feet
With colour as of fire, she made response:
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-10">"'Modicum, et non videbitis me;
Et iterum,' my sisters predilect,
'Modicum, et vos videbitis me.'"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-13">Then all the seven in front of her she placed;
And after her, by beckoning only, moved
Me and the lady and the sage who stayed.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-16">So she moved onward; and I do not think
That her tenth step was placed upon the ground,
When with her eyes upon mine eyes she smote,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-19">And with a tranquil aspect, "Come more quickly,"
To me she said, "that, if I speak with thee,
To listen to me thou mayst be well placed."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-22">As soon as I was with her as I should be,
She said to me: "Why, brother, dost thou not
Venture to question now, in coming with me?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-25">As unto those who are too reverential,
Speaking in presence of superiors,
Who drag no living utterance to their teeth,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-28">It me befell, that without perfect sound
Began I: "My necessity, Madonna,
You know, and that which thereunto is good."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-31">And she to me: "Of fear and bashfulness
Henceforward I will have thee strip thyself,
So that thou speak no more as one who dreams.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-34">Know that the vessel which the serpent broke
Was, and is not; but let him who is guilty
Think that God's vengeance does not fear a sop.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-37">Without an heir shall not for ever be
The Eagle that left his plumes upon the car,
Whence it became a monster, then a prey;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-40">For verily I see, and hence narrate it,
The stars already near to bring the time,
From every hindrance safe, and every bar,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-43">Within which a Five-hundred, Ten, and Five,
One sent from God, shall slay the thievish woman
And that same giant who is sinning with her.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-46">And peradventure my dark utterance,
Like Themis and the Sphinx, may less persuade thee,
Since, in their mode, it clouds the intellect;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-49">But soon the facts shall be the Naiades
Who shall this difficult enigma solve,
Without destruction of the flocks and harvests.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-52">Note thou; and even as by me are uttered
These words, so teach them unto those who live
That life which is a running unto death;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-55">And bear in mind, whene'er thou writest them,
Not to conceal what thou hast seen the plant,
That twice already has been pillaged here.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-58">Whoever pillages or shatters it,
With blasphemy of deed offendeth God,
Who made it holy for his use alone.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-61">For biting that, in pain and in desire
Five thousand years and more the first-born soul
Craved Him, who punished in himself the bite.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-64">Thy genius slumbers, if it deem it not
For special reason so pre-eminent
In height, and so inverted in its summit.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-67">And if thy vain imaginings had not been
Water of Elsa round about thy mind,
And Pyramus to the mulberry, their pleasure,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-70">Thou by so many circumstances only
The justice of the interdict of God
Morally in the tree wouldst recognize.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-73">But since I see thee in thine intellect
Converted into stone and stained with sin,
So that the light of my discourse doth daze thee,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-76">I will too, if not written, at least painted,
Thou bear it back within thee, for the reason
That cinct with palm the pilgrim's staff is borne."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-79">And I: "As by a signet is the wax
Which does not change the figure stamped upon it,
My brain is now imprinted by yourself.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-82">But wherefore so beyond my power of sight
Soars your desirable discourse, that aye
The more I strive, so much the more I lose it?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-85">"That thou mayst recognize," she said, "the school
Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how far
Its doctrine follows after my discourse,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-88">And mayst behold your path from the divine
Distant as far as separated is
From earth the heaven that highest hastens on."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-91">Whence her I answered: "I do not remember
That ever I estranged myself from you,
Nor have I conscience of it that reproves me."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-94">"And if thou art not able to remember,"
Smiling she answered, "recollect thee now
That thou this very day hast drunk of Lethe;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-97">And if from smoke a fire may be inferred,
Such an oblivion clearly demonstrates
Some error in thy will elsewhere intent.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-100">Truly from this time forward shall my words
Be naked, so far as it is befitting
To lay them open unto thy rude gaze."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-103">And more coruscant and with slower steps
The sun was holding the meridian circle,
Which, with the point of view, shifts here and there
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-106">When halted (as he cometh to a halt,
Who goes before a squadron as its escort,
If something new he find upon his way)
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-109">The ladies seven at a dark shadow's edge,
Such as, beneath green leaves and branches black,
The Alp upon its frigid border wears.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-112">In front of them the Tigris and Euphrates
Methought I saw forth issue from one fountain,
And slowly part, like friends, from one another.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-115">"O light, O glory of the human race!
What stream is this which here unfolds itself
From out one source, and from itself withdraws?"
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-118">For such a prayer, 'twas said unto me, "Pray
Matilda that she tell thee;" and here answered,
As one does who doth free himself from blame,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-121">The beautiful lady: "This and other things
Were told to him by me; and sure I am
The water of Lethe has not hid them from him."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-124">And Beatrice: "Perhaps a greater care,
Which oftentimes our memory takes away,
Has made the vision of his mind obscure.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-127">But Eunoe behold, that yonder rises;
Lead him to it, and, as thou art accustomed,
Revive again the half-dead virtue in him."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-130">Like gentle soul, that maketh no excuse,
But makes its own will of another's will
As soon as by a sign it is disclosed,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-133">Even so, when she had taken hold of me,
The beautiful lady moved, and unto Statius
Said, in her womanly manner, "Come with him."
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-136">If, Reader, I possessed a longer space
For writing it, I yet would sing in part
Of the sweet draught that ne'er would satiate me;
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-139">But inasmuch as full are all the leaves
Made ready for this second canticle,
The curb of art no farther lets me go.
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-142">From the most holy water I returned
Regenerate, in the manner of new trees
That are renewed with a new foliage,
</p>

<p id="purgatorio-xxxiii-145">Pure and disposed to mount unto the stars.
</p>

# PARADISO

## Paradiso - Canto I

<p id="paradiso-i-1">The glory of Him who moveth everything
Doth penetrate the universe, and shine
In one part more and in another less.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-4">Within that heaven which most his light receives
Was I, and things beheld which to repeat
Nor knows, nor can, who from above descends;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-7">Because in drawing near to its desire
Our intellect ingulphs itself so far,
That after it the memory cannot go.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-10">Truly whatever of the holy realm
I had the power to treasure in my mind
Shall now become the subject of my song.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-13">O good Apollo, for this last emprise
Make of me such a vessel of thy power
As giving the beloved laurel asks!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-16">One summit of Parnassus hitherto
Has been enough for me, but now with both
I needs must enter the arena left.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-19">Enter into my bosom, thou, and breathe
As at the time when Marsyas thou didst draw
Out of the scabbard of those limbs of his.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-22">O power divine, lend'st thou thyself to me
So that the shadow of the blessed realm
Stamped in my brain I can make manifest,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-25">Thou'lt see me come unto thy darling tree,
And crown myself thereafter with those leaves
Of which the theme and thou shall make me worthy.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-28">So seldom, Father, do we gather them
For triumph or of Caesar or of Poet,
(The fault and shame of human inclinations,)
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-31">That the Peneian foliage should bring forth
Joy to the joyous Delphic deity,
When any one it makes to thirst for it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-34">A little spark is followed by great flame;
Perchance with better voices after me
Shall prayer be made that Cyrrha may respond!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-37">To mortal men by passages diverse
Uprises the world's lamp; but by that one
Which circles four uniteth with three crosses,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-40">With better course and with a better star
Conjoined it issues, and the mundane wax
Tempers and stamps more after its own fashion.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-43">Almost that passage had made morning there
And evening here, and there was wholly white
That hemisphere, and black the other part,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-46">When Beatrice towards the left-hand side
I saw turned round, and gazing at the sun;
Never did eagle fasten so upon it!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-49">And even as a second ray is wont
To issue from the first and reascend,
Like to a pilgrim who would fain return,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-52">Thus of her action, through the eyes infused
In my imagination, mine I made,
And sunward fixed mine eyes beyond our wont.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-55">There much is lawful which is here unlawful
Unto our powers, by virtue of the place
Made for the human species as its own.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-58">Not long I bore it, nor so little while
But I beheld it sparkle round about
Like iron that comes molten from the fire;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-61">And suddenly it seemed that day to day
Was added, as if He who has the power
Had with another sun the heaven adorned.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-64">With eyes upon the everlasting wheels
Stood Beatrice all intent, and I, on her
Fixing my vision from above removed,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-67">Such at her aspect inwardly became
As Glaucus, tasting of the herb that made him
Peer of the other gods beneath the sea.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-70">To represent transhumanise in words
Impossible were; the example, then, suffice
Him for whom Grace the experience reserves.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-73">If I was merely what of me thou newly
Createdst, Love who governest the heaven,
Thou knowest, who didst lift me with thy light!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-76">When now the wheel, which thou dost make eternal
Desiring thee, made me attentive to it
By harmony thou dost modulate and measure,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-79">Then seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled
By the sun's flame, that neither rain nor river
E'er made a lake so widely spread abroad.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-82">The newness of the sound and the great light
Kindled in me a longing for their cause,
Never before with such acuteness felt;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-85">Whence she, who saw me as I saw myself,
To quiet in me my perturbed mind,
Opened her mouth, ere I did mine to ask,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-88">And she began: "Thou makest thyself so dull
With false imagining, that thou seest not
What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-91">Thou art not upon earth, as thou believest;
But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site,
Ne'er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-94">If of my former doubt I was divested
By these brief little words more smiled than spoken,
I in a new one was the more ensnared;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-97">And said: "Already did I rest content
From great amazement; but am now amazed
In what way I transcend these bodies light."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-100">Whereupon she, after a pitying sigh,
Her eyes directed tow'rds me with that look
A mother casts on a delirious child;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-103">And she began: "All things whate'er they be
Have order among themselves, and this is form,
That makes the universe resemble God.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-106">Here do the higher creatures see the footprints
Of the Eternal Power, which is the end
Whereto is made the law already mentioned.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-109">In the order that I speak of are inclined
All natures, by their destinies diverse,
More or less near unto their origin;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-112">Hence they move onward unto ports diverse
O'er the great sea of being; and each one
With instinct given it which bears it on.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-115">This bears away the fire towards the moon;
This is in mortal hearts the motive power
This binds together and unites the earth.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-118">Nor only the created things that are
Without intelligence this bow shoots forth,
But those that have both intellect and love.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-121">The Providence that regulates all this
Makes with its light the heaven forever quiet,
Wherein that turns which has the greatest haste.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-124">And thither now, as to a site decreed,
Bears us away the virtue of that cord
Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-127">True is it, that as oftentimes the form
Accords not with the intention of the art,
Because in answering is matter deaf,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-130">So likewise from this course doth deviate
Sometimes the creature, who the power possesses,
Though thus impelled, to swerve some other way,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-133">(In the same wise as one may see the fire
Fall from a cloud,) if the first impetus
Earthward is wrested by some false delight.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-136">Thou shouldst not wonder more, if well I judge,
At thine ascent, than at a rivulet
From some high mount descending to the lowland.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-139">Marvel it would be in thee, if deprived
Of hindrance, thou wert seated down below,
As if on earth the living fire were quiet."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-i-142">Thereat she heavenward turned again her face.
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto II

<p id="paradiso-ii-1">O Ye, who in some pretty little boat,
Eager to listen, have been following
Behind my ship, that singing sails along,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-4">Turn back to look again upon your shores;
Do not put out to sea, lest peradventure,
In losing me, you might yourselves be lost.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-7">The sea I sail has never yet been passed;
Minerva breathes, and pilots me Apollo,
And Muses nine point out to me the Bears.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-10">Ye other few who have the neck uplifted
Betimes to th' bread of Angels upon which
One liveth here and grows not sated by it,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-13">Well may you launch upon the deep salt-sea
Your vessel, keeping still my wake before you
Upon the water that grows smooth again.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-16">Those glorious ones who unto Colchos passed
Were not so wonder-struck as you shall be,
When Jason they beheld a ploughman made!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-19">The con-created and perpetual thirst
For the realm deiform did bear us on,
As swift almost as ye the heavens behold.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-22">Upward gazed Beatrice, and I at her;
And in such space perchance as strikes a bolt
And flies, and from the notch unlocks itself,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-25">Arrived I saw me where a wondrous thing
Drew to itself my sight; and therefore she
From whom no care of mine could be concealed,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-28">Towards me turning, blithe as beautiful,
Said unto me: "Fix gratefully thy mind
On God, who unto the first star has brought us."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-31">It seemed to me a cloud encompassed us,
Luminous, dense, consolidate and bright
As adamant on which the sun is striking.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-34">Into itself did the eternal pearl
Receive us, even as water doth receive
A ray of light, remaining still unbroken.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-37">If I was body, (and we here conceive not
How one dimension tolerates another,
Which needs must be if body enter body,)
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-40">More the desire should be enkindled in us
That essence to behold, wherein is seen
How God and our own nature were united.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-43">There will be seen what we receive by faith,
Not demonstrated, but self-evident
In guise of the first truth that man believes.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-46">I made reply: "Madonna, as devoutly
As most I can do I give thanks to Him
Who has removed me from the mortal world.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-49">But tell me what the dusky spots may be
Upon this body, which below on earth
Make people tell that fabulous tale of Cain?"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-52">Somewhat she smiled; and then, "If the opinion
Of mortals be erroneous," she said,
"Where'er the key of sense doth not unlock,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-55">Certes, the shafts of wonder should not pierce thee
Now, forasmuch as, following the senses,
Thou seest that the reason has short wings.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-58">But tell me what thou think'st of it thyself."
And I: "What seems to us up here diverse,
Is caused, I think, by bodies rare and dense."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-61">And she: "Right truly shalt thou see immersed
In error thy belief, if well thou hearest
The argument that I shall make against it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-64">Lights many the eighth sphere displays to you
Which in their quality and quantity
May noted be of aspects different.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-67">If this were caused by rare and dense alone,
One only virtue would there be in all
Or more or less diffused, or equally.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-70">Virtues diverse must be perforce the fruits
Of formal principles; and these, save one,
Of course would by thy reasoning be destroyed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-73">Besides, if rarity were of this dimness
The cause thou askest, either through and through
This planet thus attenuate were of matter,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-76">Or else, as in a body is apportioned
The fat and lean, so in like manner this
Would in its volume interchange the leaves.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-79">Were it the former, in the sun's eclipse
It would be manifest by the shining through
Of light, as through aught tenuous interfused.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-82">This is not so; hence we must scan the other,
And if it chance the other I demolish,
Then falsified will thy opinion be.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-85">But if this rarity go not through and through,
There needs must be a limit, beyond which
Its contrary prevents the further passing,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-88">And thence the foreign radiance is reflected,
Even as a colour cometh back from glass,
The which behind itself concealeth lead.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-91">Now thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself
More dimly there than in the other parts,
By being there reflected farther back.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-94">From this reply experiment will free thee
If e'er thou try it, which is wont to be
The fountain to the rivers of your arts.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-97">Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove
Alike from thee, the other more remote
Between the former two shall meet thine eyes.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-100">Turned towards these, cause that behind thy back
Be placed a light, illuming the three mirrors
And coming back to thee by all reflected.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-103">Though in its quantity be not so ample
The image most remote, there shalt thou see
How it perforce is equally resplendent.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-106">Now, as beneath the touches of warm rays
Naked the subject of the snow remains
Both of its former colour and its cold,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-109">Thee thus remaining in thy intellect,
Will I inform with such a living light,
That it shall tremble in its aspect to thee.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-112">Within the heaven of the divine repose
Revolves a body, in whose virtue lies
The being of whatever it contains.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-115">The following heaven, that has so many eyes,
Divides this being by essences diverse,
Distinguished from it, and by it contained.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-118">The other spheres, by various differences,
All the distinctions which they have within them
Dispose unto their ends and their effects.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-121">Thus do these organs of the world proceed,
As thou perceivest now, from grade to grade;
Since from above they take, and act beneath.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-124">Observe me well, how through this place I come
Unto the truth thou wishest, that hereafter
Thou mayst alone know how to keep the ford
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-127">The power and motion of the holy spheres,
As from the artisan the hammer's craft,
Forth from the blessed motors must proceed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-130">The heaven, which lights so manifold make fair,
From the Intelligence profound, which turns it,
The image takes, and makes of it a seal.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-133">And even as the soul within your dust
Through members different and accommodated
To faculties diverse expands itself,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-136">So likewise this Intelligence diffuses
Its virtue multiplied among the stars.
Itself revolving on its unity.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-139">Virtue diverse doth a diverse alloyage
Make with the precious body that it quickens,
In which, as life in you, it is combined.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-142">From the glad nature whence it is derived,
The mingled virtue through the body shines,
Even as gladness through the living pupil.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-145">From this proceeds whate'er from light to light
Appeareth different, not from dense and rare:
This is the formal principle that produces,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ii-148">According to its goodness, dark and bright."
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto III

<p id="paradiso-iii-1">That Sun, which erst with love my bosom warmed,
Of beauteous truth had unto me discovered,
By proving and reproving, the sweet aspect.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-4">And, that I might confess myself convinced
And confident, so far as was befitting,
I lifted more erect my head to speak.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-7">But there appeared a vision, which withdrew me
So close to it, in order to be seen,
That my confession I remembered not.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-10">Such as through polished and transparent glass,
Or waters crystalline and undisturbed,
But not so deep as that their bed be lost,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-13">Come back again the outlines of our faces
So feeble, that a pearl on forehead white
Comes not less speedily unto our eyes;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-16">Such saw I many faces prompt to speak,
So that I ran in error opposite
To that which kindled love 'twixt man and fountain.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-19">As soon as I became aware of them,
Esteeming them as mirrored semblances,
To see of whom they were, mine eyes I turned,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-22">And nothing saw, and once more turned them forward
Direct into the light of my sweet Guide,
Who smiling kindled in her holy eyes.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-25">"Marvel thou not," she said to me, "because
I smile at this thy puerile conceit,
Since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-28">But turns thee, as 'tis wont, on emptiness.
True substances are these which thou beholdest,
Here relegate for breaking of some vow.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-31">Therefore speak with them, listen and believe;
For the true light, which giveth peace to them,
Permits them not to turn from it their feet."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-34">And I unto the shade that seemed most wishful
To speak directed me, and I began,
As one whom too great eagerness bewilders:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-37">"O well-created spirit, who in the rays
Of life eternal dost the sweetness taste
Which being untasted ne'er is comprehended,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-40">Grateful 'twill be to me, if thou content me
Both with thy name and with your destiny."
Whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-43">"Our charity doth never shut the doors
Against a just desire, except as one
Who wills that all her court be like herself.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-46">I was a virgin sister in the world;
And if thy mind doth contemplate me well,
The being more fair will not conceal me from thee,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-49">But thou shalt recognise I am Piccarda,
Who, stationed here among these other blessed,
Myself am blessed in the slowest sphere.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-52">All our affections, that alone inflamed
Are in the pleasure of the Holy Ghost,
Rejoice at being of his order formed;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-55">And this allotment, which appears so low,
Therefore is given us, because our vows
Have been neglected and in some part void."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-58">Whence I to her: "In your miraculous aspects
There shines I know not what of the divine,
Which doth transform you from our first conceptions.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-61">Therefore I was not swift in my remembrance;
But what thou tellest me now aids me so,
That the refiguring is easier to me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-64">But tell me, ye who in this place are happy,
Are you desirous of a higher place,
To see more or to make yourselves more friends?"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-67">First with those other shades she smiled a little;
Thereafter answered me so full of gladness,
She seemed to burn in the first fire of love:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-70">"Brother, our will is quieted by virtue
Of charity, that makes us wish alone
For what we have, nor gives us thirst for more.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-73">If to be more exalted we aspired,
Discordant would our aspirations be
Unto the will of Him who here secludes us;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-76">Which thou shalt see finds no place in these circles,
If being in charity is needful here,
And if thou lookest well into its nature;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-79">Nay, 'tis essential to this blest existence
To keep itself within the will divine,
Whereby our very wishes are made one;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-82">So that, as we are station above station
Throughout this realm, to all the realm 'tis pleasing,
As to the King, who makes his will our will.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-85">And his will is our peace; this is the sea
To which is moving onward whatsoever
It doth create, and all that nature makes."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-88">Then it was clear to me how everywhere
In heaven is Paradise, although the grace
Of good supreme there rain not in one measure.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-91">But as it comes to pass, if one food sates,
And for another still remains the longing,
We ask for this, and that decline with thanks,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-94">E'en thus did I; with gesture and with word,
To learn from her what was the web wherein
She did not ply the shuttle to the end.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-97">"A perfect life and merit high in-heaven
A lady o'er us," said she, "by whose rule
Down in your world they vest and veil themselves,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-100">That until death they may both watch and sleep
Beside that Spouse who every vow accepts
Which charity conformeth to his pleasure.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-103">To follow her, in girlhood from the world
I fled, and in her habit shut myself,
And pledged me to the pathway of her sect.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-106">Then men accustomed unto evil more
Than unto good, from the sweet cloister tore me;
God knows what afterward my life became.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-109">This other splendour, which to thee reveals
Itself on my right side, and is enkindled
With all the illumination of our sphere,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-112">What of myself I say applies to her;
A nun was she, and likewise from her head
Was ta'en the shadow of the sacred wimple.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-115">But when she too was to the world returned
Against her wishes and against good usage,
Of the heart's veil she never was divested.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-118">Of great Costanza this is the effulgence,
Who from the second wind of Suabia
Brought forth the third and latest puissance."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-121">Thus unto me she spake, and then began
"Ave Maria" singing, and in singing
Vanished, as through deep water something heavy.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-124">My sight, that followed her as long a time
As it was possible, when it had lost her
Turned round unto the mark of more desire,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-127">And wholly unto Beatrice reverted;
But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes,
That at the first my sight endured it not;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iii-130">And this in questioning more backward made me.
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto IV

<p id="paradiso-iv-1">Between two viands, equally removed
And tempting, a free man would die of hunger
Ere either he could bring unto his teeth.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-4">So would a lamb between the ravenings
Of two fierce wolves stand fearing both alike;
And so would stand a dog between two does.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-7">Hence, if I held my peace, myself I blame not,
Impelled in equal measure by my doubts,
Since it must be so, nor do I commend.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-10">I held my peace; but my desire was painted
Upon my face, and questioning with that
More fervent far than by articulate speech.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-13">Beatrice did as Daniel had done
Relieving Nebuchadnezzar from the wrath
Which rendered him unjustly merciless,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-16">And said: "Well see I how attracteth thee
One and the other wish, so that thy care
Binds itself so that forth it does not breathe.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-19">Thou arguest, if good will be permanent,
The violence of others, for what reason
Doth it decrease the measure of my merit?
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-22">Again for doubting furnish thee occasion
Souls seeming to return unto the stars,
According to the sentiment of Plato.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-25">These are the questions which upon thy wish
Are thrusting equally; and therefore first
Will I treat that which hath the most of gall.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-28">He of the Seraphim most absorbed in God,
Moses, and Samuel, and whichever John
Thou mayst select, I say, and even Mary,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-31">Have not in any other heaven their seats,
Than have those spirits that just appeared to thee,
Nor of existence more or fewer years;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-34">But all make beautiful the primal circle,
And have sweet life in different degrees,
By feeling more or less the eternal breath.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-37">They showed themselves here, not because allotted
This sphere has been to them, but to give sign
Of the celestial which is least exalted.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-40">To speak thus is adapted to your mind,
Since only through the sense it apprehendeth
What then it worthy makes of intellect.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-43">On this account the Scripture condescends
Unto your faculties, and feet and hands
To God attributes, and means something else;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-46">And Holy Church under an aspect human
Gabriel and Michael represent to you,
And him who made Tobias whole again.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-49">That which Timaeus argues of the soul
Doth not resemble that which here is seen,
Because it seems that as he speaks he thinks.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-52">He says the soul unto its star returns,
Believing it to have been severed thence
Whenever nature gave it as a form.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-55">Perhaps his doctrine is of other guise
Than the words sound, and possibly may be
With meaning that is not to be derided.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-58">If he doth mean that to these wheels return
The honour of their influence and the blame,
Perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-61">This principle ill understood once warped
The whole world nearly, till it went astray
Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-64">The other doubt which doth disquiet thee
Less venom has, for its malevolence
Could never lead thee otherwhere from me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-67">That as unjust our justice should appear
In eyes of mortals, is an argument
Of faith, and not of sin heretical.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-70">But still, that your perception may be able
To thoroughly penetrate this verity,
As thou desirest, I will satisfy thee.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-73">If it be violence when he who suffers
Co-operates not with him who uses force,
These souls were not on that account excused;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-76">For will is never quenched unless it will,
But operates as nature doth in fire
If violence a thousand times distort it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-79">Hence, if it yieldeth more or less, it seconds
The force; and these have done so, having power
Of turning back unto the holy place.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-82">If their will had been perfect, like to that
Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held,
And Mutius made severe to his own hand,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-85">It would have urged them back along the road
Whence they were dragged, as soon as they were free;
But such a solid will is all too rare.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-88">And by these words, if thou hast gathered them
As thou shouldst do, the argument is refuted
That would have still annoyed thee many times.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-91">But now another passage runs across
Before thine eyes, and such that by thyself
Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-94">I have for certain put into thy mind
That soul beatified could never lie,
For it is near the primal Truth,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-97">And then thou from Piccarda might'st have heard
Costanza kept affection for the veil,
So that she seemeth here to contradict me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-100">Many times, brother, has it come to pass,
That, to escape from peril, with reluctance
That has been done it was not right to do,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-103">E'en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father
Thereto entreated, his own mother slew)
Not to lose pity pitiless became.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-106">At this point I desire thee to remember
That force with will commingles, and they cause
That the offences cannot be excused.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-109">Will absolute consenteth not to evil;
But in so far consenteth as it fears,
If it refrain, to fall into more harm.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-112">Hence when Piccarda uses this expression,
She meaneth the will absolute, and I
The other, so that both of us speak truth."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-115">Such was the flowing of the holy river
That issued from the fount whence springs all truth;
This put to rest my wishes one and all.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-118">"O love of the first lover, O divine,"
Said I forthwith, "whose speech inundates me
And warms me so, it more and more revives me,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-121">My own affection is not so profound
As to suffice in rendering grace for grace;
Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-124">Well I perceive that never sated is
Our intellect unless the Truth illume it,
Beyond which nothing true expands itself.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-127">It rests therein, as wild beast in his lair,
When it attains it; and it can attain it;
If not, then each desire would frustrate be.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-130">Therefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot,
Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature,
Which to the top from height to height impels us.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-133">This doth invite me, this assurance give me
With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you
Another truth, which is obscure to me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-136">I wish to know if man can satisfy you
For broken vows with other good deeds, so
That in your balance they will not be light."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-139">Beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes
Full of the sparks of love, and so divine,
That, overcome my power, I turned my back
</p>

<p id="paradiso-iv-142">And almost lost myself with eyes downcast.
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto V

<p id="paradiso-v-1">"If in the heat of love I flame upon thee
Beyond the measure that on earth is seen,
So that the valour of thine eyes I vanquish,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-4">Marvel thou not thereat; for this proceeds
From perfect sight, which as it apprehends
To the good apprehended moves its feet.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-7">Well I perceive how is already shining
Into thine intellect the eternal light,
That only seen enkindles always love;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-10">And if some other thing your love seduce,
'Tis nothing but a vestige of the same,
Ill understood, which there is shining through.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-13">Thou fain wouldst know if with another service
For broken vow can such return be made
As to secure the soul from further claim."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-16">This Canto thus did Beatrice begin;
And, as a man who breaks not off his speech,
Continued thus her holy argument:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-19">"The greatest gift that in his largess God
Creating made, and unto his own goodness
Nearest conformed, and that which he doth prize
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-22">Most highly, is the freedom of the will,
Wherewith the creatures of intelligence
Both all and only were and are endowed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-25">Now wilt thou see, if thence thou reasonest,
The high worth of a vow, if it he made
So that when thou consentest God consents:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-28">For, closing between God and man the compact,
A sacrifice is of this treasure made,
Such as I say, and made by its own act.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-31">What can be rendered then as compensation?
Think'st thou to make good use of what thou'st offered,
With gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-34">Now art thou certain of the greater point;
But because Holy Church in this dispenses,
Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-37">Behoves thee still to sit awhile at table,
Because the solid food which thou hast taken
Requireth further aid for thy digestion.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-40">Open thy mind to that which I reveal,
And fix it there within; for 'tis not knowledge,
The having heard without retaining it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-43">In the essence of this sacrifice two things
Convene together; and the one is that
Of which 'tis made, the other is the agreement.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-46">This last for evermore is cancelled not
Unless complied with, and concerning this
With such precision has above been spoken.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-49">Therefore it was enjoined upon the Hebrews
To offer still, though sometimes what was offered
Might be commuted, as thou ought'st to know.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-52">The other, which is known to thee as matter,
May well indeed be such that one errs not
If it for other matter be exchanged.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-55">But let none shift the burden on his shoulder
At his arbitrament, without the turning
Both of the white and of the yellow key;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-58">And every permutation deem as foolish,
If in the substitute the thing relinquished,
As the four is in six, be not contained.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-61">Therefore whatever thing has so great weight
In value that it drags down every balance,
Cannot be satisfied with other spending.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-64">Let mortals never take a vow in jest;
Be faithful and not blind in doing that,
As Jephthah was in his first offering,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-67">Whom more beseemed to say, 'I have done wrong,
Than to do worse by keeping; and as foolish
Thou the great leader of the Greeks wilt find,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-70">Whence wept Iphigenia her fair face,
And made for her both wise and simple weep,
Who heard such kind of worship spoken of.'
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-73">Christians, be ye more serious in your movements;
Be ye not like a feather at each wind,
And think not every water washes you.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-76">Ye have the Old and the New Testament,
And the Pastor of the Church who guideth you
Let this suffice you unto your salvation.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-79">If evil appetite cry aught else to you,
Be ye as men, and not as silly sheep,
So that the Jew among you may not mock you.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-82">Be ye not as the lamb that doth abandon
Its mother's milk, and frolicsome and simple
Combats at its own pleasure with itself."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-85">Thus Beatrice to me even as I write it;
Then all desireful turned herself again
To that part where the world is most alive.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-88">Her silence and her change of countenance
Silence imposed upon my eager mind,
That had already in advance new questions;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-91">And as an arrow that upon the mark
Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become,
So did we speed into the second realm.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-94">My Lady there so joyful I beheld,
As into the brightness of that heaven she entered,
More luminous thereat the planet grew;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-97">And if the star itself was changed and smiled,
What became I, who by my nature am
Exceeding mutable in every guise!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-100">As, in a fish-pond which is pure and tranquil,
The fishes draw to that which from without
Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-103">So I beheld more than a thousand splendours
Drawing towards us, and in each was heard:
"Lo, this is she who shall increase our love."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-106">And as each one was coming unto us,
Full of beatitude the shade was seen,
By the effulgence clear that issued from it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-109">Think, Reader, if what here is just beginning
No farther should proceed, how thou wouldst have
An agonizing need of knowing more;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-112">And of thyself thou'lt see how I from these
Was in desire of hearing their conditions,
As they unto mine eyes were manifest.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-115">"O thou well-born, unto whom Grace concedes
To see the thrones of the eternal triumph,
Or ever yet the warfare be abandoned
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-118">With light that through the whole of heaven is spread
Kindled are we, and hence if thou desirest
To know of us, at thine own pleasure sate thee."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-121">Thus by some one among those holy spirits
Was spoken, and by Beatrice: "Speak, speak
Securely, and believe them even as Gods."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-124">"Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself
In thine own light, and drawest it from thine eyes,
Because they coruscate when thou dost smile,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-127">But know not who thou art, nor why thou hast,
Spirit august, thy station in the sphere
That veils itself to men in alien rays."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-130">This said I in direction of the light
Which first had spoken to me; whence it became
By far more lucent than it was before.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-133">Even as the sun, that doth conceal himself
By too much light, when heat has worn away
The tempering influence of the vapours dense,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-136">By greater rapture thus concealed itself
In its own radiance the figure saintly,
And thus close, close enfolded answered me
</p>

<p id="paradiso-v-139">In fashion as the following Canto sings.
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto VI

<p id="paradiso-vi-1">"After that Constantine the eagle turned
Against the course of heaven, which it had followed
Behind the ancient who Lavinia took,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-4">Two hundred years and more the bird of God
In the extreme of Europe held itself,
Near to the mountains whence it issued first;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-7">And under shadow of the sacred plumes
It governed there the world from hand to hand,
And, changing thus, upon mine own alighted.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-10">Caesar I was, and am Justinian,
Who, by the will of primal Love I feel,
Took from the laws the useless and redundant;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-13">And ere unto the work I was attent,
One nature to exist in Christ, not more,
Believed, and with such faith was I contented.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-16">But blessed Agapetus, he who was
The supreme pastor, to the faith sincere
Pointed me out the way by words of his.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-19">Him I believed, and what was his assertion
I now see clearly, even as thou seest
Each contradiction to be false and true.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-22">As soon as with the Church I moved my feet,
God in his grace it pleased with this high task
To inspire me, and I gave me wholly to it,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-25">And to my Belisarius I commended
The arms, to which was heaven's right hand so joined
It was a signal that I should repose.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-28">Now here to the first question terminates
My answer; but the character thereof
Constrains me to continue with a sequel,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-31">In order that thou see with how great reason
Men move against the standard sacrosanct,
Both who appropriate and who oppose it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-34">Behold how great a power has made it worthy
Of reverence, beginning from the hour
When Pallas died to give it sovereignty.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-37">Thou knowest it made in Alba its abode
Three hundred years and upward, till at last
The three to three fought for it yet again.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-40">Thou knowest what it achieved from Sabine wrong
Down to Lucretia's sorrow, in seven kings
O'ercoming round about the neighboring nations;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-43">Thou knowest what it achieved, borne by the Romans
Illustrious against Brennus, against Pyrrhus,
Against the other princes and confederates.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-46">Torquatus thence and Quinctius, who from locks
Unkempt was named, Decii and Fabii,
Received the fame I willingly embalm;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-49">It struck to earth the pride of the Arabians,
Who, following Hannibal, had passed across
The Alpine ridges, Po, from which thou glidest;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-52">Beneath it triumphed while they yet were young
Pompey and Scipio, and to the hill
Beneath which thou wast born it bitter seemed;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-55">Then, near unto the time when heaven had willed
To bring the whole world to its mood serene,
Did Caesar by the will of Rome assume it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-58">What it achieved from Var unto the Rhine,
Isere beheld and Saone, beheld the Seine,
And every valley whence the Rhone is filled;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-61">What it achieved when it had left Ravenna,
And leaped the Rubicon, was such a flight
That neither tongue nor pen could follow it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-64">Round towards Spain it wheeled its legions; then
Towards Durazzo, and Pharsalia smote
That to the calid Nile was felt the pain.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-67">Antandros and the Simois, whence it started,
It saw again, and there where Hector lies,
And ill for Ptolemy then roused itself.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-70">From thence it came like lightning upon Juba;
Then wheeled itself again into your West,
Where the Pompeian clarion it heard.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-73">From what it wrought with the next standard-bearer
Brutus and Cassius howl in Hell together,
And Modena and Perugia dolent were;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-76">Still doth the mournful Cleopatra weep
Because thereof, who, fleeing from before it,
Took from the adder sudden and black death.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-79">With him it ran even to the Red Sea shore;
With him it placed the world in so great peace,
That unto Janus was his temple closed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-82">But what the standard that has made me speak
Achieved before, and after should achieve
Throughout the mortal realm that lies beneath it,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-85">Becometh in appearance mean and dim,
If in the hand of the third Caesar seen
With eye unclouded and affection pure,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-88">Because the living Justice that inspires me
Granted it, in the hand of him I speak of,
The glory of doing vengeance for its wrath.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-91">Now here attend to what I answer thee;
Later it ran with Titus to do vengeance
Upon the vengeance of the ancient sin.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-94">And when the tooth of Lombardy had bitten
The Holy Church, then underneath its wings
Did Charlemagne victorious succor her.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-97">Now hast thou power to judge of such as those
Whom I accused above, and of their crimes,
Which are the cause of all your miseries.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-100">To the public standard one the yellow lilies
Opposes, the other claims it for a party,
So that 'tis hard to see which sins the most.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-103">Let, let the Ghibellines ply their handicraft
Beneath some other standard; for this ever
Ill follows he who it and justice parts.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-106">And let not this new Charles e'er strike it down,
He and his Guelfs, but let him fear the talons
That from a nobler lion stripped the fell.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-109">Already oftentimes the sons have wept
The father's crime; and let him not believe
That God will change His scutcheon for the lilies.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-112">This little planet doth adorn itself
With the good spirits that have active been,
That fame and honour might come after them;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-115">And whensoever the desires mount thither,
Thus deviating, must perforce the rays
Of the true love less vividly mount upward.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-118">But in commensuration of our wages
With our desert is portion of our joy,
Because we see them neither less nor greater.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-121">Herein doth living Justice sweeten so
Affection in us, that for evermore
It cannot warp to any iniquity.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-124">Voices diverse make up sweet melodies;
So in this life of ours the seats diverse
Render sweet harmony among these spheres;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-127">And in the compass of this present pearl
Shineth the sheen of Romeo, of whom
The grand and beauteous work was ill rewarded.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-130">But the Provencals who against him wrought,
They have not laughed, and therefore ill goes he
Who makes his hurt of the good deeds of others.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-133">Four daughters, and each one of them a queen,
Had Raymond Berenger, and this for him
Did Romeo, a poor man and a pilgrim;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-136">And then malicious words incited him
To summon to a reckoning this just man,
Who rendered to him seven and five for ten.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-139">Then he departed poor and stricken in years,
And if the world could know the heart he had,
In begging bit by bit his livelihood,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vi-142">Though much it laud him, it would laud him more."
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto VII

<p id="paradiso-vii-1">"Osanna sanctus Deus Sabaoth,
Superillustrans claritate tua
Felices ignes horum malahoth!"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-4">In this wise, to his melody returning,
This substance, upon which a double light
Doubles itself, was seen by me to sing,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-7">And to their dance this and the others moved,
And in the manner of swift-hurrying sparks
Veiled themselves from me with a sudden distance.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-10">Doubting was I, and saying, "Tell her, tell her,"
Within me, "tell her," saying, "tell my Lady,"
Who slakes my thirst with her sweet effluences;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-13">And yet that reverence which doth lord it over
The whole of me only by B and ICE,
Bowed me again like unto one who drowses.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-16">Short while did Beatrice endure me thus;
And she began, lighting me with a smile
Such as would make one happy in the fire:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-19">"According to infallible advisement,
After what manner a just vengeance justly
Could be avenged has put thee upon thinking,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-22">But I will speedily thy mind unloose;
And do thou listen, for these words of mine
Of a great doctrine will a present make thee.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-25">By not enduring on the power that wills
Curb for his good, that man who ne'er was born,
Damning himself damned all his progeny;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-28">Whereby the human species down below
Lay sick for many centuries in great error,
Till to descend it pleased the Word of God
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-31">To where the nature, which from its own Maker
Estranged itself, he joined to him in person
By the sole act of his eternal love.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-34">Now unto what is said direct thy sight;
This nature when united to its Maker,
Such as created, was sincere and good;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-37">But by itself alone was banished forth
From Paradise, because it turned aside
Out of the way of truth and of its life.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-40">Therefore the penalty the cross held out,
If measured by the nature thus assumed,
None ever yet with so great justice stung,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-43">And none was ever of so great injustice,
Considering who the Person was that suffered,
Within whom such a nature was contracted.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-46">From one act therefore issued things diverse;
To God and to the Jews one death was pleasing;
Earth trembled at it and the Heaven was opened.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-49">It should no longer now seem difficult
To thee, when it is said that a just vengeance
By a just court was afterward avenged.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-52">But now do I behold thy mind entangled
From thought to thought within a knot, from which
With great desire it waits to free itself.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-55">Thou sayest, 'Well discern I what I hear;
But it is hidden from me why God willed
For our redemption only this one mode.'
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-58">Buried remaineth, brother, this decree
Unto the eyes of every one whose nature
Is in the flame of love not yet adult.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-61">Verily, inasmuch as at this mark
One gazes long and little is discerned,
Wherefore this mode was worthiest will I say.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-64">Goodness Divine, which from itself doth spurn
All envy, burning in itself so sparkles
That the eternal beauties it unfolds.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-67">Whate'er from this immediately distils
Has afterwards no end, for ne'er removed
Is its impression when it sets its seal.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-70">Whate'er from this immediately rains down
Is wholly free, because it is not subject
Unto the influences of novel things.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-73">The more conformed thereto, the more it pleases;
For the blest ardour that irradiates all things
In that most like itself is most vivacious.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-76">With all of these things has advantaged been
The human creature; and if one be wanting,
From his nobility he needs must fall.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-79">'Tis sin alone which doth disfranchise him,
And render him unlike the Good Supreme,
So that he little with its light is blanched,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-82">And to his dignity no more returns,
Unless he fill up where transgression empties
With righteous pains for criminal delights.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-85">Your nature when it sinned so utterly
In its own seed, out of these dignities
Even as out of Paradise was driven,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-88">Nor could itself recover, if thou notest
With nicest subtilty, by any way,
Except by passing one of these two fords:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-91">Either that God through clemency alone
Had pardon granted, or that man himself
Had satisfaction for his folly made.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-94">Fix now thine eye deep into the abyss
Of the eternal counsel, to my speech
As far as may be fastened steadfastly!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-97">Man in his limitations had not power
To satisfy, not having power to sink
In his humility obeying then,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-100">Far as he disobeying thought to rise;
And for this reason man has been from power
Of satisfying by himself excluded.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-103">Therefore it God behoved in his own ways
Man to restore unto his perfect life,
I say in one, or else in both of them.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-106">But since the action of the doer is
So much more grateful, as it more presents
The goodness of the heart from which it issues,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-109">Goodness Divine, that doth imprint the world,
Has been contented to proceed by each
And all its ways to lift you up again;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-112">Nor 'twixt the first day and the final night
Such high and such magnificent proceeding
By one or by the other was or shall be;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-115">For God more bounteous was himself to give
To make man able to uplift himself,
Than if he only of himself had pardoned;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-118">And all the other modes were insufficient
For justice, were it not the Son of God
Himself had humbled to become incarnate.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-121">Now, to fill fully each desire of thine,
Return I to elucidate one place,
In order that thou there mayst see as I do.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-124">Thou sayst: 'I see the air, I see the fire,
The water, and the earth, and all their mixtures
Come to corruption, and short while endure;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-127">And these things notwithstanding were created;'
Therefore if that which I have said were true,
They should have been secure against corruption.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-130">The Angels, brother, and the land sincere
In which thou art, created may be called
Just as they are in their entire existence;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-133">But all the elements which thou hast named,
And all those things which out of them are made,
By a created virtue are informed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-136">Created was the matter which they have;
Created was the informing influence
Within these stars that round about them go.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-139">The soul of every brute and of the plants
By its potential temperament attracts
The ray and motion of the holy lights;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-142">But your own life immediately inspires
Supreme Beneficence, and enamours it
So with herself, it evermore desires her.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-145">And thou from this mayst argue furthermore
Your resurrection, if thou think again
How human flesh was fashioned at that time
</p>

<p id="paradiso-vii-148">When the first parents both of them were made."
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto VIII

<p id="paradiso-viii-1">The world used in its peril to believe
That the fair Cypria delirious love
Rayed out, in the third epicycle turning;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-4">Wherefore not only unto her paid honour
Of sacrifices and of votive cry
The ancient nations in the ancient error,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-7">But both Dione honoured they and Cupid,
That as her mother, this one as her son,
And said that he had sat in Dido's lap;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-10">And they from her, whence I beginning take,
Took the denomination of the star
That woos the sun, now following, now in front.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-13">I was not ware of our ascending to it;
But of our being in it gave full faith
My Lady whom I saw more beauteous grow.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-16">And as within a flame a spark is seen,
And as within a voice a voice discerned,
When one is steadfast, and one comes and goes,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-19">Within that light beheld I other lamps
Move in a circle, speeding more and less,
Methinks in measure of their inward vision.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-22">From a cold cloud descended never winds,
Or visible or not, so rapidly
They would not laggard and impeded seem
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-25">To any one who had those lights divine
Seen come towards us, leaving the gyration
Begun at first in the high Seraphim.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-28">And behind those that most in front appeared
Sounded "Osanna!" so that never since
To hear again was I without desire.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-31">Then unto us more nearly one approached,
And it alone began: "We all are ready
Unto thy pleasure, that thou joy in us.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-34">We turn around with the celestial Princes,
One gyre and one gyration and one thirst,
To whom thou in the world of old didst say,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-37">'Ye who, intelligent, the third heaven are moving;'
And are so full of love, to pleasure thee
A little quiet will not be less sweet."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-40">After these eyes of mine themselves had offered
Unto my Lady reverently, and she
Content and certain of herself had made them,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-43">Back to the light they turned, which so great promise
Made of itself, and "Say, who art thou?" was
My voice, imprinted with a great affection.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-46">O how and how much I beheld it grow
With the new joy that superadded was
Unto its joys, as soon as I had spoken!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-49">Thus changed, it said to me: "The world possessed me
Short time below; and, if it had been more,
Much evil will be which would not have been.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-52">My gladness keepeth me concealed from thee,
Which rayeth round about me, and doth hide me
Like as a creature swathed in its own silk.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-55">Much didst thou love me, and thou hadst good reason;
For had I been below, I should have shown thee
Somewhat beyond the foliage of my love.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-58">That left-hand margin, which doth bathe itself
In Rhone, when it is mingled with the Sorgue,
Me for its lord awaited in due time,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-61">And that horn of Ausonia, which is towned
With Bari, with Gaeta and Catona,
Whence Tronto and Verde in the sea disgorge.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-64">Already flashed upon my brow the crown
Of that dominion which the Danube waters
After the German borders it abandons;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-67">And beautiful Trinacria, that is murky
'Twixt Pachino and Peloro, (on the gulf
Which greatest scath from Eurus doth receive,)
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-70">Not through Typhoeus, but through nascent sulphur,
Would have awaited her own monarchs still,
Through me from Charles descended and from Rudolph,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-73">If evil lordship, that exasperates ever
The subject populations, had not moved
Palermo to the outcry of 'Death! death!'
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-76">And if my brother could but this foresee,
The greedy poverty of Catalonia
Straight would he flee, that it might not molest him;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-79">For verily 'tis needful to provide,
Through him or other, so that on his bark
Already freighted no more freight be placed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-82">His nature, which from liberal covetous
Descended, such a soldiery would need
As should not care for hoarding in a chest."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-85">"Because I do believe the lofty joy
Thy speech infuses into me, my Lord,
Where every good thing doth begin and end
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-88">Thou seest as I see it, the more grateful
Is it to me; and this too hold I dear,
That gazing upon God thou dost discern it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-91">Glad hast thou made me; so make clear to me,
Since speaking thou hast stirred me up to doubt,
How from sweet seed can bitter issue forth."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-94">This I to him; and he to me: "If I
Can show to thee a truth, to what thou askest
Thy face thou'lt hold as thou dost hold thy back.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-97">The Good which all the realm thou art ascending
Turns and contents, maketh its providence
To be a power within these bodies vast;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-100">And not alone the natures are foreseen
Within the mind that in itself is perfect,
But they together with their preservation.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-103">For whatsoever thing this bow shoots forth
Falls foreordained unto an end foreseen,
Even as a shaft directed to its mark.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-106">If that were not, the heaven which thou dost walk
Would in such manner its effects produce,
That they no longer would be arts, but ruins.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-109">This cannot be, if the Intelligences
That keep these stars in motion are not maimed,
And maimed the First that has not made them perfect.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-112">Wilt thou this truth have clearer made to thee?"
And I: "Not so; for 'tis impossible
That nature tire, I see, in what is needful."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-115">Whence he again: "Now say, would it be worse
For men on earth were they not citizens?"
"Yes," I replied; "and here I ask no reason."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-118">"And can they be so, if below they live not
Diversely unto offices diverse?
No, if your master writeth well for you."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-121">So came he with deductions to this point;
Then he concluded: "Therefore it behoves
The roots of your effects to be diverse.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-124">Hence one is Solon born, another Xerxes,
Another Melchisedec, and another he
Who, flying through the air, his son did lose.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-127">Revolving Nature, which a signet is
To mortal wax, doth practise well her art,
But not one inn distinguish from another;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-130">Thence happens it that Esau differeth
In seed from Jacob; and Quirinus comes
From sire so vile that he is given to Mars.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-133">A generated nature its own way
Would always make like its progenitors,
If Providence divine were not triumphant.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-136">Now that which was behind thee is before thee;
But that thou know that I with thee am pleased,
With a corollary will I mantle thee.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-139">Evermore nature, if it fortune find
Discordant to it, like each other seed
Out of its region, maketh evil thrift;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-142">And if the world below would fix its mind
On the foundation which is laid by nature,
Pursuing that, 'twould have the people good.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-145">But you unto religion wrench aside
Him who was born to gird him with the sword,
And make a king of him who is for sermons;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-viii-148">Therefore your footsteps wander from the road."
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto IX

<p id="paradiso-ix-1">Beautiful Clemence, after that thy Charles
Had me enlightened, he narrated to me
The treacheries his seed should undergo;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-4">But said: "Be still and let the years roll round;"
So I can only say, that lamentation
Legitimate shall follow on your wrongs.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-7">And of that holy light the life already
Had to the Sun which fills it turned again,
As to that good which for each thing sufficeth.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-10">Ah, souls deceived, and creatures impious,
Who from such good do turn away your hearts,
Directing upon vanity your foreheads!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-13">And now, behold, another of those splendours
Approached me, and its will to pleasure me
It signified by brightening outwardly.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-16">The eyes of Beatrice, that fastened were
Upon me, as before, of dear assent
To my desire assurance gave to me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-19">"Ah, bring swift compensation to my wish,
Thou blessed spirit," I said, "and give me proof
That what I think in thee I can reflect!"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-22">Whereat the light, that still was new to me,
Out of its depths, whence it before was singing,
As one delighted to do good, continued:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-25">"Within that region of the land depraved
Of Italy, that lies between Rialto
And fountain-heads of Brenta and of Piava,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-28">Rises a hill, and mounts not very high,
Wherefrom descended formerly a torch
That made upon that region great assault.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-31">Out of one root were born both I and it;
Cunizza was I called, and here I shine
Because the splendour of this star o'ercame me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-34">But gladly to myself the cause I pardon
Of my allotment, and it does not grieve me;
Which would perhaps seem strong unto your vulgar.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-37">Of this so luculent and precious jewel,
Which of our heaven is nearest unto me,
Great fame remained; and ere it die away
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-40">This hundredth year shall yet quintupled be.
See if man ought to make him excellent,
So that another life the first may leave!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-43">And thus thinks not the present multitude
Shut in by Adige and Tagliamento,
Nor yet for being scourged is penitent.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-46">But soon 'twill be that Padua in the marsh
Will change the water that Vicenza bathes,
Because the folk are stubborn against duty;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-49">And where the Sile and Cagnano join
One lordeth it, and goes with lofty head,
For catching whom e'en now the net is making.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-52">Feltro moreover of her impious pastor
Shall weep the crime, which shall so monstrous be
That for the like none ever entered Malta.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-55">Ample exceedingly would be the vat
That of the Ferrarese could hold the blood,
And weary who should weigh it ounce by ounce,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-58">Of which this courteous priest shall make a gift
To show himself a partisan; and such gifts
Will to the living of the land conform.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-61">Above us there are mirrors, Thrones you call them,
From which shines out on us God Judicant,
So that this utterance seems good to us."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-64">Here it was silent, and it had the semblance
Of being turned elsewhither, by the wheel
On which it entered as it was before.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-67">The other joy, already known to me,
Became a thing transplendent in my sight,
As a fine ruby smitten by the sun.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-70">Through joy effulgence is acquired above,
As here a smile; but down below, the shade
Outwardly darkens, as the mind is sad.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-73">"God seeth all things, and in Him, blest spirit,
Thy sight is," said I, "so that never will
Of his can possibly from thee be hidden;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-76">Thy voice, then, that for ever makes the heavens
Glad, with the singing of those holy fires
Which of their six wings make themselves a cowl,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-79">Wherefore does it not satisfy my longings?
Indeed, I would not wait thy questioning
If I in thee were as thou art in me."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-82">"The greatest of the valleys where the water
Expands itself," forthwith its words began,
"That sea excepted which the earth engarlands,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-85">Between discordant shores against the sun
Extends so far, that it meridian makes
Where it was wont before to make the horizon.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-88">I was a dweller on that valley's shore
'Twixt Ebro and Magra that with journey short
Doth from the Tuscan part the Genoese.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-91">With the same sunset and same sunrise nearly
Sit Buggia and the city whence I was,
That with its blood once made the harbour hot.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-94">Folco that people called me unto whom
My name was known; and now with me this heaven
Imprints itself, as I did once with it;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-97">For more the daughter of Belus never burned,
Offending both Sichaeus and Creusa,
Than I, so long as it became my locks,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-100">Nor yet that Rodophean, who deluded
was by Demophoon, nor yet Alcides,
When Iole he in his heart had locked.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-103">Yet here is no repenting, but we smile,
Not at the fault, which comes not back to mind,
But at the power which ordered and foresaw.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-106">Here we behold the art that doth adorn
With such affection, and the good discover
Whereby the world above turns that below.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-109">But that thou wholly satisfied mayst bear
Thy wishes hence which in this sphere are born,
Still farther to proceed behoveth me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-112">Thou fain wouldst know who is within this light
That here beside me thus is scintillating,
Even as a sunbeam in the limpid water.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-115">Then know thou, that within there is at rest
Rahab, and being to our order joined,
With her in its supremest grade 'tis sealed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-118">Into this heaven, where ends the shadowy cone
Cast by your world, before all other souls
First of Christ's triumph was she taken up.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-121">Full meet it was to leave her in some heaven,
Even as a palm of the high victory
Which he acquired with one palm and the other,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-124">Because she favoured the first glorious deed
Of Joshua upon the Holy Land,
That little stirs the memory of the Pope.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-127">Thy city, which an offshoot is of him
Who first upon his Maker turned his back,
And whose ambition is so sorely wept,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-130">Brings forth and scatters the accursed flower
Which both the sheep and lambs hath led astray
Since it has turned the shepherd to a wolf.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-133">For this the Evangel and the mighty Doctors
Are derelict, and only the Decretals
So studied that it shows upon their margins.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-136">On this are Pope and Cardinals intent;
Their meditations reach not Nazareth,
There where his pinions Gabriel unfolded;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-139">But Vatican and the other parts elect
Of Rome, which have a cemetery been
Unto the soldiery that followed Peter
</p>

<p id="paradiso-ix-142">Shall soon be free from this adultery."
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto X

<p id="paradiso-x-1">Looking into his Son with all the Love
Which each of them eternally breathes forth,
The Primal and unutterable Power
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-4">Whate'er before the mind or eye revolves
With so much order made, there can be none
Who this beholds without enjoying Him.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-7">Lift up then, Reader, to the lofty wheels
With me thy vision straight unto that part
Where the one motion on the other strikes,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-10">And there begin to contemplate with joy
That Master's art, who in himself so loves it
That never doth his eye depart therefrom.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-13">Behold how from that point goes branching off
The oblique circle, which conveys the planets,
To satisfy the world that calls upon them;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-16">And if their pathway were not thus inflected,
Much virtue in the heavens would be in vain,
And almost every power below here dead.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-19">If from the straight line distant more or less
Were the departure, much would wanting be
Above and underneath of mundane order.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-22">Remain now, Reader, still upon thy bench,
In thought pursuing that which is foretasted,
If thou wouldst jocund be instead of weary.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-25">I've set before thee; henceforth feed thyself,
For to itself diverteth all my care
That theme whereof I have been made the scribe.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-28">The greatest of the ministers of nature,
Who with the power of heaven the world imprints
And measures with his light the time for us,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-31">With that part which above is called to mind
Conjoined, along the spirals was revolving,
Where each time earlier he presents himself;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-34">And I was with him; but of the ascending
I was not conscious, saving as a man
Of a first thought is conscious ere it come;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-37">And Beatrice, she who is seen to pass
From good to better, and so suddenly
That not by time her action is expressed,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-40">How lucent in herself must she have been!
And what was in the sun, wherein I entered,
Apparent not by colour but by light,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-43">I, though I call on genius, art, and practice,
Cannot so tell that it could be imagined;
Believe one can, and let him long to see it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-46">And if our fantasies too lowly are
For altitude so great, it is no marvel,
Since o'er the sun was never eye could go.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-49">Such in this place was the fourth family
Of the high Father, who forever sates it,
Showing how he breathes forth and how begets.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-52">And Beatrice began: "Give thanks, give thanks
Unto the Sun of Angels, who to this
Sensible one has raised thee by his grace!"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-55">Never was heart of mortal so disposed
To worship, nor to give itself to God
With all its gratitude was it so ready,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-58">As at those words did I myself become;
And all my love was so absorbed in Him,
That in oblivion Beatrice was eclipsed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-61">Nor this displeased her; but she smiled at it
So that the splendour of her laughing eyes
My single mind on many things divided.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-64">Lights many saw I, vivid and triumphant,
Make us a centre and themselves a circle,
More sweet in voice than luminous in aspect.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-67">Thus girt about the daughter of Latona
We sometimes see, when pregnant is the air,
So that it holds the thread which makes her zone.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-70">Within the court of Heaven, whence I return,
Are many jewels found, so fair and precious
They cannot be transported from the realm;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-73">And of them was the singing of those lights.
Who takes not wings that he may fly up thither,
The tidings thence may from the dumb await!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-76">As soon as singing thus those burning suns
Had round about us whirled themselves three times,
Like unto stars neighbouring the steadfast poles,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-79">Ladies they seemed, not from the dance released,
But who stop short, in silence listening
Till they have gathered the new melody.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-82">And within one I heard beginning: "When
The radiance of grace, by which is kindled
True love, and which thereafter grows by loving,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-85">Within thee multiplied is so resplendent
That it conducts thee upward by that stair,
Where without reascending none descends,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-88">Who should deny the wine out of his vial
Unto thy thirst, in liberty were not
Except as water which descends not seaward.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-91">Fain wouldst thou know with what plants is enflowered
This garland that encircles with delight
The Lady fair who makes thee strong for heaven.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-94">Of the lambs was I of the holy flock
Which Dominic conducteth by a road
Where well one fattens if he strayeth not.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-97">He who is nearest to me on the right
My brother and master was; and he Albertus
Is of Cologne, I Thomas of Aquinum.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-100">If thou of all the others wouldst be certain,
Follow behind my speaking with thy sight
Upward along the blessed garland turning.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-103">That next effulgence issues from the smile
Of Gratian, who assisted both the courts
In such wise that it pleased in Paradise.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-106">The other which near by adorns our choir
That Peter was who, e'en as the poor widow,
Offered his treasure unto Holy Church.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-109">The fifth light, that among us is the fairest,
Breathes forth from such a love, that all the world
Below is greedy to learn tidings of it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-112">Within it is the lofty mind, where knowledge
So deep was put, that, if the true be true,
To see so much there never rose a second.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-115">Thou seest next the lustre of that taper,
Which in the flesh below looked most within
The angelic nature and its ministry.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-118">Within that other little light is smiling
The advocate of the Christian centuries,
Out of whose rhetoric Augustine was furnished.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-121">Now if thou trainest thy mind's eye along
From light to light pursuant of my praise,
With thirst already of the eighth thou waitest.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-124">By seeing every good therein exults
The sainted soul, which the fallacious world
Makes manifest to him who listeneth well;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-127">The body whence 'twas hunted forth is lying
Down in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom
And banishment it came unto this peace.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-130">See farther onward flame the burning breath
Of Isidore, of Beda, and of Richard
Who was in contemplation more than man.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-133">This, whence to me returneth thy regard,
The light is of a spirit unto whom
In his grave meditations death seemed slow.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-136">It is the light eternal of Sigier,
Who, reading lectures in the Street of Straw,
Did syllogize invidious verities."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-139">Then, as a horologe that calleth us
What time the Bride of God is rising up
With matins to her Spouse that he may love her,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-142">Wherein one part the other draws and urges,
Ting! ting! resounding with so sweet a note,
That swells with love the spirit well disposed,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-145">Thus I beheld the glorious wheel move round,
And render voice to voice, in modulation
And sweetness that can not be comprehended,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-x-148">Excepting there where joy is made eternal.
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XI

<p id="paradiso-xi-1">O Thou insensate care of mortal men,
How inconclusive are the syllogisms
That make thee beat thy wings in downward flight!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-4">One after laws and one to aphorisms
Was going, and one following the priesthood,
And one to reign by force or sophistry,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-7">And one in theft, and one in state affairs,
One in the pleasures of the flesh involved
Wearied himself, one gave himself to ease;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-10">When I, from all these things emancipate,
With Beatrice above there in the Heavens
With such exceeding glory was received!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-13">When each one had returned unto that point
Within the circle where it was before,
It stood as in a candlestick a candle;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-16">And from within the effulgence which at first
Had spoken unto me, I heard begin
Smiling while it more luminous became:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-19">"Even as I am kindled in its ray,
So, looking into the Eternal Light,
The occasion of thy thoughts I apprehend.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-22">Thou doubtest, and wouldst have me to resift
In language so extended and so open
My speech, that to thy sense it may be plain,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-25">Where just before I said, 'where well one fattens,'
And where I said, 'there never rose a second;'
And here 'tis needful we distinguish well.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-28">The Providence, which governeth the world
With counsel, wherein all created vision
Is vanquished ere it reach unto the bottom,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-31">(So that towards her own Beloved might go
The bride of Him who, uttering a loud cry,
Espoused her with his consecrated blood,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-34">Self-confident and unto Him more faithful,)
Two Princes did ordain in her behoof,
Which on this side and that might be her guide.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-37">The one was all seraphical in ardour;
The other by his wisdom upon earth
A splendour was of light cherubical.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-40">One will I speak of, for of both is spoken
In praising one, whichever may be taken,
Because unto one end their labours were.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-43">Between Tupino and the stream that falls
Down from the hill elect of blessed Ubald,
A fertile slope of lofty mountain hangs,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-46">From which Perugia feels the cold and heat
Through Porta Sole, and behind it weep
Gualdo and Nocera their grievous yoke.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-49">From out that slope, there where it breaketh most
Its steepness, rose upon the world a sun
As this one does sometimes from out the Ganges;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-52">Therefore let him who speaketh of that place,
Say not Ascesi, for he would say little,
But Orient, if he properly would speak.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-55">He was not yet far distant from his rising
Before he had begun to make the earth
Some comfort from his mighty virtue feel.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-58">For he in youth his father's wrath incurred
For certain Dame, to whom, as unto death,
The gate of pleasure no one doth unlock;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-61">And was before his spiritual court
'Et coram patre' unto her united;
Then day by day more fervently he loved her.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-64">She, reft of her first husband, scorned, obscure,
One thousand and one hundred years and more,
Waited without a suitor till he came.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-67">Naught it availed to hear, that with Amyclas
Found her unmoved at sounding of his voice
He who struck terror into all the world;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-70">Naught it availed being constant and undaunted,
So that, when Mary still remained below,
She mounted up with Christ upon the cross.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-73">But that too darkly I may not proceed,
Francis and Poverty for these two lovers
Take thou henceforward in my speech diffuse.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-76">Their concord and their joyous semblances,
The love, the wonder, and the sweet regard,
They made to be the cause of holy thoughts;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-79">So much so that the venerable Bernard
First bared his feet, and after so great peace
Ran, and, in running, thought himself too slow.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-82">O wealth unknown!  O veritable good!
Giles bares his feet, and bares his feet Sylvester
Behind the bridegroom, so doth please the bride!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-85">Then goes his way that father and that master,
He and his Lady and that family
Which now was girding on the humble cord;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-88">Nor cowardice of heart weighed down his brow
At being son of Peter Bernardone,
Nor for appearing marvellously scorned;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-91">But regally his hard determination
To Innocent he opened, and from him
Received the primal seal upon his Order.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-94">After the people mendicant increased
Behind this man, whose admirable life
Better in glory of the heavens were sung,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-97">Incoronated with a second crown
Was through Honorius by the Eternal Spirit
The holy purpose of this Archimandrite.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-100">And when he had, through thirst of martyrdom,
In the proud presence of the Sultan preached
Christ and the others who came after him,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-103">And, finding for conversion too unripe
The folk, and not to tarry there in vain,
Returned to fruit of the Italic grass,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-106">On the rude rock 'twixt Tiber and the Arno
From Christ did he receive the final seal,
Which during two whole years his members bore.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-109">When He, who chose him unto so much good,
Was pleased to draw him up to the reward
That he had merited by being lowly,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-112">Unto his friars, as to the rightful heirs,
His most dear Lady did he recommend,
And bade that they should love her faithfully;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-115">And from her bosom the illustrious soul
Wished to depart, returning to its realm,
And for its body wished no other bier.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-118">Think now what man was he, who was a fit
Companion over the high seas to keep
The bark of Peter to its proper bearings.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-121">And this man was our Patriarch; hence whoever
Doth follow him as he commands can see
That he is laden with good merchandise.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-124">But for new pasturage his flock has grown
So greedy, that it is impossible
They be not scattered over fields diverse;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-127">And in proportion as his sheep remote
And vagabond go farther off from him,
More void of milk return they to the fold.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-130">Verily some there are that fear a hurt,
And keep close to the shepherd; but so few,
That little cloth doth furnish forth their hoods.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-133">Now if my utterance be not indistinct,
If thine own hearing hath attentive been,
If thou recall to mind what I have said,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-136">In part contented shall thy wishes be;
For thou shalt see the plant that's chipped away,
And the rebuke that lieth in the words,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xi-139">'Where well one fattens, if he strayeth not.'"
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XII

<p id="paradiso-xii-1">Soon as the blessed flame had taken up
The final word to give it utterance,
Began the holy millstone to revolve,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-4">And in its gyre had not turned wholly round,
Before another in a ring enclosed it,
And motion joined to motion, song to song;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-7">Song that as greatly doth transcend our Muses,
Our Sirens, in those dulcet clarions,
As primal splendour that which is reflected.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-10">And as are spanned athwart a tender cloud
Two rainbows parallel and like in colour,
When Juno to her handmaid gives command,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-13">(The one without born of the one within,
Like to the speaking of that vagrant one
Whom love consumed as doth the sun the vapours,)
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-16">And make the people here, through covenant
God set with Noah, presageful of the world
That shall no more be covered with a flood,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-19">In such wise of those sempiternal roses
The garlands twain encompassed us about,
And thus the outer to the inner answered.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-22">After the dance, and other grand rejoicings,
Both of the singing, and the flaming forth
Effulgence with effulgence blithe and tender,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-25">Together, at once, with one accord had stopped,
(Even as the eyes, that, as volition moves them,
Must needs together shut and lift themselves,)
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-28">Out of the heart of one of the new lights
There came a voice, that needle to the star
Made me appear in turning thitherward.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-31">And it began: "The love that makes me fair
Draws me to speak about the other leader,
By whom so well is spoken here of mine.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-34">'Tis right, where one is, to bring in the other,
That, as they were united in their warfare,
Together likewise may their glory shine.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-37">The soldiery of Christ, which it had cost
So dear to arm again, behind the standard
Moved slow and doubtful and in numbers few,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-40">When the Emperor who reigneth evermore
Provided for the host that was in peril,
Through grace alone and not that it was worthy;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-43">And, as was said, he to his Bride brought succour
With champions twain, at whose deed, at whose word
The straggling people were together drawn.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-46">Within that region where the sweet west wind
Rises to open the new leaves, wherewith
Europe is seen to clothe herself afresh,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-49">Not far off from the beating of the waves,
Behind which in his long career the sun
Sometimes conceals himself from every man,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-52">Is situate the fortunate Calahorra,
Under protection of the mighty shield
In which the Lion subject is and sovereign.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-55">Therein was born the amorous paramour
Of Christian Faith, the athlete consecrate,
Kind to his own and cruel to his foes;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-58">And when it was created was his mind
Replete with such a living energy,
That in his mother her it made prophetic.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-61">As soon as the espousals were complete
Between him and the Faith at holy font,
Where they with mutual safety dowered each other,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-64">The woman, who for him had given assent,
Saw in a dream the admirable fruit
That issue would from him and from his heirs;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-67">And that he might be construed as he was,
A spirit from this place went forth to name him
With His possessive whose he wholly was.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-70">Dominic was he called; and him I speak of
Even as of the husbandman whom Christ
Elected to his garden to assist him.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-73">Envoy and servant sooth he seemed of Christ,
For the first love made manifest in him
Was the first counsel that was given by Christ.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-76">Silent and wakeful many a time was he
Discovered by his nurse upon the ground,
As if he would have said, 'For this I came.'
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-79">O thou his father, Felix verily!
O thou his mother, verily Joanna,
If this, interpreted, means as is said!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-82">Not for the world which people toil for now
In following Ostiense and Taddeo,
But through his longing after the true manna,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-85">He in short time became so great a teacher,
That he began to go about the vineyard,
Which fadeth soon, if faithless be the dresser;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-88">And of the See, (that once was more benignant
Unto the righteous poor, not through itself,
But him who sits there and degenerates,)
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-91">Not to dispense or two or three for six,
Not any fortune of first vacancy,
'Non decimas quae sunt pauperum Dei,'
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-94">He asked for, but against the errant world
Permission to do battle for the seed,
Of which these four and twenty plants surround thee.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-97">Then with the doctrine and the will together,
With office apostolical he moved,
Like torrent which some lofty vein out-presses;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-100">And in among the shoots heretical
His impetus with greater fury smote,
Wherever the resistance was the greatest.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-103">Of him were made thereafter divers runnels,
Whereby the garden catholic is watered,
So that more living its plantations stand.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-106">If such the one wheel of the Biga was,
In which the Holy Church itself defended
And in the field its civic battle won,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-109">Truly full manifest should be to thee
The excellence of the other, unto whom
Thomas so courteous was before my coming.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-112">But still the orbit, which the highest part
Of its circumference made, is derelict,
So that the mould is where was once the crust.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-115">His family, that had straight forward moved
With feet upon his footprints, are turned round
So that they set the point upon the heel.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-118">And soon aware they will be of the harvest
Of this bad husbandry, when shall the tares
Complain the granary is taken from them.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-121">Yet say I, he who searcheth leaf by leaf
Our volume through, would still some page discover
Where he could read, 'I am as I am wont.'
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-124">'Twill not be from Casal nor Acquasparta,
From whence come such unto the written word
That one avoids it, and the other narrows.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-127">Bonaventura of Bagnoregio's life
Am I, who always in great offices
Postponed considerations sinister.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-130">Here are Illuminato and Agostino,
Who of the first barefooted beggars were
That with the cord the friends of God became.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-133">Hugh of Saint Victor is among them here,
And Peter Mangiador, and Peter of Spain,
Who down below in volumes twelve is shining;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-136">Nathan the seer, and metropolitan
Chrysostom, and Anselmus, and Donatus
Who deigned to lay his hand to the first art;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-139">Here is Rabanus, and beside me here
Shines the Calabrian Abbot Joachim,
He with the spirit of prophecy endowed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-142">To celebrate so great a paladin
Have moved me the impassioned courtesy
And the discreet discourses of Friar Thomas,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xii-145">And with me they have moved this company."
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XIII

<p id="paradiso-xiii-1">Let him imagine, who would well conceive
What now I saw, and let him while I speak
Retain the image as a steadfast rock,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-4">The fifteen stars, that in their divers regions
The sky enliven with a light so great
That it transcends all clusters of the air;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-7">Let him the Wain imagine unto which
Our vault of heaven sufficeth night and day,
So that in turning of its pole it fails not;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-10">Let him the mouth imagine of the horn
That in the point beginneth of the axis
Round about which the primal wheel revolves,--
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-13">To have fashioned of themselves two signs in heaven,
Like unto that which Minos' daughter made,
The moment when she felt the frost of death;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-16">And one to have its rays within the other,
And both to whirl themselves in such a manner
That one should forward go, the other backward;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-19">And he will have some shadowing forth of that
True constellation and the double dance
That circled round the point at which I was;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-22">Because it is as much beyond our wont,
As swifter than the motion of the Chiana
Moveth the heaven that all the rest outspeeds.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-25">There sang they neither Bacchus, nor Apollo,
But in the divine nature Persons three,
And in one person the divine and human.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-28">The singing and the dance fulfilled their measure,
And unto us those holy lights gave need,
Growing in happiness from care to care.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-31">Then broke the silence of those saints concordant
The light in which the admirable life
Of God's own mendicant was told to me,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-34">And said: "Now that one straw is trodden out
Now that its seed is garnered up already,
Sweet love invites me to thresh out the other.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-37">Into that bosom, thou believest, whence
Was drawn the rib to form the beauteous cheek
Whose taste to all the world is costing dear,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-40">And into that which, by the lance transfixed,
Before and since, such satisfaction made
That it weighs down the balance of all sin,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-43">Whate'er of light it has to human nature
Been lawful to possess was all infused
By the same power that both of them created;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-46">And hence at what I said above dost wonder,
When I narrated that no second had
The good which in the fifth light is enclosed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-49">Now ope thine eyes to what I answer thee,
And thou shalt see thy creed and my discourse
Fit in the truth as centre in a circle.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-52">That which can die, and that which dieth not,
Are nothing but the splendour of the idea
Which by his love our Lord brings into being;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-55">Because that living Light, which from its fount
Effulgent flows, so that it disunites not
From Him nor from the Love in them intrined,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-58">Through its own goodness reunites its rays
In nine subsistences, as in a mirror,
Itself eternally remaining One.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-61">Thence it descends to the last potencies,
Downward from act to act becoming such
That only brief contingencies it makes;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-64">And these contingencies I hold to be
Things generated, which the heaven produces
By its own motion, with seed and without.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-67">Neither their wax, nor that which tempers it,
Remains immutable, and hence beneath
The ideal signet more and less shines through;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-70">Therefore it happens, that the selfsame tree
After its kind bears worse and better fruit,
And ye are born with characters diverse.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-73">If in perfection tempered were the wax,
And were the heaven in its supremest virtue,
The brilliance of the seal would all appear;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-76">But nature gives it evermore deficient,
In the like manner working as the artist,
Who has the skill of art and hand that trembles.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-79">If then the fervent Love, the Vision clear,
Of primal Virtue do dispose and seal,
Perfection absolute is there acquired.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-82">Thus was of old the earth created worthy
Of all and every animal perfection;
And thus the Virgin was impregnate made;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-85">So that thine own opinion I commend,
That human nature never yet has been,
Nor will be, what it was in those two persons.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-88">Now if no farther forth I should proceed,
'Then in what way was he without a peer?'
Would be the first beginning of thy words.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-91">But, that may well appear what now appears not,
Think who he was, and what occasion moved him
To make request, when it was told him, 'Ask.'
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-94">I've not so spoken that thou canst not see
Clearly he was a king who asked for wisdom,
That he might be sufficiently a king;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-97">'Twas not to know the number in which are
The motors here above, or if 'necesse'
With a contingent e'er 'necesse' make,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-100">'Non si est dare primum motum esse,'
Or if in semicircle can be made
Triangle so that it have no right angle.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-103">Whence, if thou notest this and what I said,
A regal prudence is that peerless seeing
In which the shaft of my intention strikes.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-106">And if on 'rose' thou turnest thy clear eyes,
Thou'lt see that it has reference alone
To kings who're many, and the good are rare.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-109">With this distinction take thou what I said,
And thus it can consist with thy belief
Of the first father and of our Delight.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-112">And lead shall this be always to thy feet,
To make thee, like a weary man, move slowly
Both to the Yes and No thou seest not;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-115">For very low among the fools is he
Who affirms without distinction, or denies,
As well in one as in the other case;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-118">Because it happens that full often bends
Current opinion in the false direction,
And then the feelings bind the intellect.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-121">Far more than uselessly he leaves the shore,
(Since he returneth not the same he went,)
Who fishes for the truth, and has no skill;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-124">And in the world proofs manifest thereof
Parmenides, Melissus, Brissus are,
And many who went on and knew not whither;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-127">Thus did Sabellius, Arius, and those fools
Who have been even as swords unto the Scriptures
In rendering distorted their straight faces.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-130">Nor yet shall people be too confident
In judging, even as he is who doth count
The corn in field or ever it be ripe.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-133">For I have seen all winter long the thorn
First show itself intractable and fierce,
And after bear the rose upon its top;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-136">And I have seen a ship direct and swift
Run o'er the sea throughout its course entire,
To perish at the harbour's mouth at last.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-139">Let not Dame Bertha nor Ser Martin think,
Seeing one steal, another offering make,
To see them in the arbitrament divine;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiii-142">For one may rise, and fall the other may."
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XIV

<p id="paradiso-xiv-1">From centre unto rim, from rim to centre,
In a round vase the water moves itself,
As from without 'tis struck or from within.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-4">Into my mind upon a sudden dropped
What I am saying, at the moment when
Silent became the glorious life of Thomas,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-7">Because of the resemblance that was born
Of his discourse and that of Beatrice,
Whom, after him, it pleased thus to begin:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-10">"This man has need (and does not tell you so,
Nor with the voice, nor even in his thought)
Of going to the root of one truth more.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-13">Declare unto him if the light wherewith
Blossoms your substance shall remain with you
Eternally the same that it is now;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-16">And if it do remain, say in what manner,
After ye are again made visible,
It can be that it injure not your sight."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-19">As by a greater gladness urged and drawn
They who are dancing in a ring sometimes
Uplift their voices and their motions quicken;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-22">So, at that orison devout and prompt,
The holy circles a new joy displayed
In their revolving and their wondrous song.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-25">Whoso lamenteth him that here we die
That we may live above, has never there
Seen the refreshment of the eternal rain.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-28">The One and Two and Three who ever liveth,
And reigneth ever in Three and Two and One,
Not circumscribed and all things circumscribing,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-31">Three several times was chanted by each one
Among those spirits, with such melody
That for all merit it were just reward;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-34">And, in the lustre most divine of all
The lesser ring, I heard a modest voice,
Such as perhaps the Angel's was to Mary,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-37">Answer: "As long as the festivity
Of Paradise shall be, so long our love
Shall radiate round about us such a vesture.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-40">Its brightness is proportioned to the ardour,
The ardour to the vision; and the vision
Equals what grace it has above its worth.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-43">When, glorious and sanctified, our flesh
Is reassumed, then shall our persons be
More pleasing by their being all complete;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-46">For will increase whate'er bestows on us
Of light gratuitous the Good Supreme,
Light which enables us to look on Him;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-49">Therefore the vision must perforce increase,
Increase the ardour which from that is kindled,
Increase the radiance which from this proceeds.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-52">But even as a coal that sends forth flame,
And by its vivid whiteness overpowers it
So that its own appearance it maintains,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-55">Thus the effulgence that surrounds us now
Shall be o'erpowered in aspect by the flesh,
Which still to-day the earth doth cover up;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-58">Nor can so great a splendour weary us,
For strong will be the organs of the body
To everything which hath the power to please us."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-61">So sudden and alert appeared to me
Both one and the other choir to say Amen,
That well they showed desire for their dead bodies;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-64">Nor sole for them perhaps, but for the mothers,
The fathers, and the rest who had been dear
Or ever they became eternal flames.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-67">And lo! all round about of equal brightness
Arose a lustre over what was there,
Like an horizon that is clearing up.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-70">And as at rise of early eve begin
Along the welkin new appearances,
So that the sight seems real and unreal,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-73">It seemed to me that new subsistences
Began there to be seen, and make a circle
Outside the other two circumferences.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-76">O very sparkling of the Holy Spirit,
How sudden and incandescent it became
Unto mine eyes, that vanquished bore it not!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-79">But Beatrice so beautiful and smiling
Appeared to me, that with the other sights
That followed not my memory I must leave her.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-82">Then to uplift themselves mine eyes resumed
The power, and I beheld myself translated
To higher salvation with my Lady only.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-85">Well was I ware that I was more uplifted
By the enkindled smiling of the star,
That seemed to me more ruddy than its wont.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-88">With all my heart, and in that dialect
Which is the same in all, such holocaust
To God I made as the new grace beseemed;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-91">And not yet from my bosom was exhausted
The ardour of sacrifice, before I knew
This offering was accepted and auspicious;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-94">For with so great a lustre and so red
Splendours appeared to me in twofold rays,
I said: "O Helios who dost so adorn them!"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-97">Even as distinct with less and greater lights
Glimmers between the two poles of the world
The Galaxy that maketh wise men doubt,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-100">Thus constellated in the depths of Mars,
Those rays described the venerable sign
That quadrants joining in a circle make.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-103">Here doth my memory overcome my genius;
For on that cross as levin gleamed forth Christ,
So that I cannot find ensample worthy;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-106">But he who takes his cross and follows Christ
Again will pardon me what I omit,
Seeing in that aurora lighten Christ.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-109">From horn to horn, and 'twixt the top and base,
Lights were in motion, brightly scintillating
As they together met and passed each other;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-112">Thus level and aslant and swift and slow
We here behold, renewing still the sight,
The particles of bodies long and short,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-115">Across the sunbeam move, wherewith is listed
Sometimes the shade, which for their own defence
People with cunning and with art contrive.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-118">And as a lute and harp, accordant strung
With many strings, a dulcet tinkling make
To him by whom the notes are not distinguished,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-121">So from the lights that there to me appeared
Upgathered through the cross a melody,
Which rapt me, not distinguishing the hymn.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-124">Well was I ware it was of lofty laud,
Because there came to me, "Arise and conquer!"
As unto him who hears and comprehends not.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-127">So much enamoured I became therewith,
That until then there was not anything
That e'er had fettered me with such sweet bonds.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-130">Perhaps my word appears somewhat too bold,
Postponing the delight of those fair eyes,
Into which gazing my desire has rest;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-133">But who bethinks him that the living seals
Of every beauty grow in power ascending,
And that I there had not turned round to those,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-136">Can me excuse, if I myself accuse
To excuse myself, and see that I speak truly:
For here the holy joy is not disclosed,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xiv-139">Because ascending it becomes more pure.
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XV

<p id="paradiso-xv-1">A will benign, in which reveals itself
Ever the love that righteously inspires,
As in the iniquitous, cupidity,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-4">Silence imposed upon that dulcet lyre,
And quieted the consecrated chords,
That Heaven's right hand doth tighten and relax.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-7">How unto just entreaties shall be deaf
Those substances, which, to give me desire
Of praying them, with one accord grew silent?
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-10">'Tis well that without end he should lament,
Who for the love of thing that doth not last
Eternally despoils him of that love!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-13">As through the pure and tranquil evening air
There shoots from time to time a sudden fire,
Moving the eyes that steadfast were before,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-16">And seems to be a star that changeth place,
Except that in the part where it is kindled
Nothing is missed, and this endureth little;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-19">So from the horn that to the right extends
Unto that cross's foot there ran a star
Out of the constellation shining there;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-22">Nor was the gem dissevered from its ribbon,
But down the radiant fillet ran along,
So that fire seemed it behind alabaster.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-25">Thus piteous did Anchises' shade reach forward,
If any faith our greatest Muse deserve,
When in Elysium he his son perceived.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-28">"O sanguis meus, O superinfusa
Gratia Dei, sicut tibi, cui
Bis unquam Coeli janua reclusa?"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-31">Thus that effulgence; whence I gave it heed;
Then round unto my Lady turned my sight,
And on this side and that was stupefied;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-34">For in her eyes was burning such a smile
That with mine own methought I touched the bottom
Both of my grace and of my Paradise!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-37">Then, pleasant to the hearing and the sight,
The spirit joined to its beginning things
I understood not, so profound it spake;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-40">Nor did it hide itself from me by choice,
But by necessity; for its conception
Above the mark of mortals set itself.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-43">And when the bow of burning sympathy
Was so far slackened, that its speech descended
Towards the mark of our intelligence,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-46">The first thing that was understood by me
Was "Benedight be Thou, O Trine and One,
Who hast unto my seed so courteous been!"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-49">And it continued: "Hunger long and grateful,
Drawn from the reading of the mighty volume
Wherein is never changed the white nor dark,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-52">Thou hast appeased, my son, within this light
In which I speak to thee, by grace of her
Who to this lofty flight with plumage clothed thee.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-55">Thou thinkest that to me thy thought doth pass
From Him who is the first, as from the unit,
If that be known, ray out the five and six;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-58">And therefore who I am thou askest not,
And why I seem more joyous unto thee
Than any other of this gladsome crowd.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-61">Thou think'st the truth; because the small and great
Of this existence look into the mirror
Wherein, before thou think'st, thy thought thou showest.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-64">But that the sacred love, in which I watch
With sight perpetual, and which makes me thirst
With sweet desire, may better be fulfilled,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-67">Now let thy voice secure and frank and glad
Proclaim the wishes, the desire proclaim,
To which my answer is decreed already."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-70">To Beatrice I turned me, and she heard
Before I spake, and smiled to me a sign,
That made the wings of my desire increase;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-73">Then in this wise began I: "Love and knowledge,
When on you dawned the first Equality,
Of the same weight for each of you became;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-76">For in the Sun, which lighted you and burned
With heat and radiance, they so equal are,
That all similitudes are insufficient.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-79">But among mortals will and argument,
For reason that to you is manifest,
Diversely feathered in their pinions are.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-82">Whence I, who mortal am, feel in myself
This inequality; so give not thanks,
Save in my heart, for this paternal welcome.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-85">Truly do I entreat thee, living topaz!
Set in this precious jewel as a gem,
That thou wilt satisfy me with thy name."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-88">"O leaf of mine, in whom I pleasure took
E'en while awaiting, I was thine own root!"
Such a beginning he in answer made me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-91">Then said to me: "That one from whom is named
Thy race, and who a hundred years and more
Has circled round the mount on the first cornice,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-94">A son of mine and thy great-grandsire was;
Well it behoves thee that the long fatigue
Thou shouldst for him make shorter with thy works.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-97">Florence, within the ancient boundary
From which she taketh still her tierce and nones,
Abode in quiet, temperate and chaste.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-100">No golden chain she had, nor coronal,
Nor ladies shod with sandal shoon, nor girdle
That caught the eye more than the person did.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-103">Not yet the daughter at her birth struck fear
Into the father, for the time and dower
Did not o'errun this side or that the measure.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-106">No houses had she void of families,
Not yet had thither come Sardanapalus
To show what in a chamber can be done;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-109">Not yet surpassed had Montemalo been
By your Uccellatojo, which surpassed
Shall in its downfall be as in its rise.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-112">Bellincion Berti saw I go begirt
With leather and with bone, and from the mirror
His dame depart without a painted face;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-115">And him of Nerli saw, and him of Vecchio,
Contented with their simple suits of buff
And with the spindle and the flax their dames.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-118">O fortunate women! and each one was certain
Of her own burial-place, and none as yet
For sake of France was in her bed deserted.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-121">One o'er the cradle kept her studious watch,
And in her lullaby the language used
That first delights the fathers and the mothers;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-124">Another, drawing tresses from her distaff,
Told o'er among her family the tales
Of Trojans and of Fesole and Rome.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-127">As great a marvel then would have been held
A Lapo Salterello, a Cianghella,
As Cincinnatus or Cornelia now.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-130">To such a quiet, such a beautiful
Life of the citizen, to such a safe
Community, and to so sweet an inn,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-133">Did Mary give me, with loud cries invoked,
And in your ancient Baptistery at once
Christian and Cacciaguida I became.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-136">Moronto was my brother, and Eliseo;
From Val di Pado came to me my wife,
And from that place thy surname was derived.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-139">I followed afterward the Emperor Conrad,
And he begirt me of his chivalry,
So much I pleased him with my noble deeds.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-142">I followed in his train against that law's
Iniquity, whose people doth usurp
Your just possession, through your Pastor's fault.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-145">There by that execrable race was I
Released from bonds of the fallacious world,
The love of which defileth many souls,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xv-148">And came from martyrdom unto this peace."
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XVI

<p id="paradiso-xvi-1">O thou our poor nobility of blood,
If thou dost make the people glory in thee
Down here where our affection languishes,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-4">A marvellous thing it ne'er will be to me;
For there where appetite is not perverted,
I say in Heaven, of thee I made a boast!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-7">Truly thou art a cloak that quickly shortens,
So that unless we piece thee day by day
Time goeth round about thee with his shears!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-10">With 'You,' which Rome was first to tolerate,
(Wherein her family less perseveres,)
Yet once again my words beginning made;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-13">Whence Beatrice, who stood somewhat apart,
Smiling, appeared like unto her who coughed
At the first failing writ of Guenever.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-16">And I began: "You are my ancestor,
You give to me all hardihood to speak,
You lift me so that I am more than I.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-19">So many rivulets with gladness fill
My mind, that of itself it makes a joy
Because it can endure this and not burst.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-22">Then tell me, my beloved root ancestral,
Who were your ancestors, and what the years
That in your boyhood chronicled themselves?
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-25">Tell me about the sheepfold of Saint John,
How large it was, and who the people were
Within it worthy of the highest seats."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-28">As at the blowing of the winds a coal
Quickens to flame, so I beheld that light
Become resplendent at my blandishments.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-31">And as unto mine eyes it grew more fair,
With voice more sweet and tender, but not in
This modern dialect, it said to me:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-34">"From uttering of the 'Ave,' till the birth
In which my mother, who is now a saint,
Of me was lightened who had been her burden,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-37">Unto its Lion had this fire returned
Five hundred fifty times and thirty more,
To reinflame itself beneath his paw.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-40">My ancestors and I our birthplace had
Where first is found the last ward of the city
By him who runneth in your annual game.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-43">Suffice it of my elders to hear this;
But who they were, and whence they thither came,
Silence is more considerate than speech.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-46">All those who at that time were there between
Mars and the Baptist, fit for bearing arms,
Were a fifth part of those who now are living;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-49">But the community, that now is mixed
With Campi and Certaldo and Figghine,
Pure in the lowest artisan was seen.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-52">O how much better 'twere to have as neighbours
The folk of whom I speak, and at Galluzzo
And at Trespiano have your boundary,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-55">Than have them in the town, and bear the stench
Of Aguglione's churl, and him of Signa
Who has sharp eyes for trickery already.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-58">Had not the folk, which most of all the world
Degenerates, been a step-dame unto Caesar,
But as a mother to her son benignant,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-61">Some who turn Florentines, and trade and discount,
Would have gone back again to Simifonte
There where their grandsires went about as beggars.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-64">At Montemurlo still would be the Counts,
The Cerchi in the parish of Acone,
Perhaps in Valdigrieve the Buondelmonti.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-67">Ever the intermingling of the people
Has been the source of malady in cities,
As in the body food it surfeits on;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-70">And a blind bull more headlong plunges down
Than a blind lamb; and very often cuts
Better and more a single sword than five.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-73">If Luni thou regard, and Urbisaglia,
How they have passed away, and how are passing
Chiusi and Sinigaglia after them,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-76">To hear how races waste themselves away,
Will seem to thee no novel thing nor hard,
Seeing that even cities have an end.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-79">All things of yours have their mortality,
Even as yourselves; but it is hidden in some
That a long while endure, and lives are short;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-82">And as the turning of the lunar heaven
Covers and bares the shores without a pause,
In the like manner fortune does with Florence.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-85">Therefore should not appear a marvellous thing
What I shall say of the great Florentines
Of whom the fame is hidden in the Past.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-88">I saw the Ughi, saw the Catellini,
Filippi, Greci, Ormanni, and Alberichi,
Even in their fall illustrious citizens;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-91">And saw, as mighty as they ancient were,
With him of La Sannella him of Arca,
And Soldanier, Ardinghi, and Bostichi.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-94">Near to the gate that is at present laden
With a new felony of so much weight
That soon it shall be jetsam from the bark,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-97">The Ravignani were, from whom descended
The County Guido, and whoe'er the name
Of the great Bellincione since hath taken.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-100">He of La Pressa knew the art of ruling
Already, and already Galigajo
Had hilt and pommel gilded in his house.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-103">Mighty already was the Column Vair,
Sacchetti, Giuochi, Fifant, and Barucci,
And Galli, and they who for the bushel blush.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-106">The stock from which were the Calfucci born
Was great already, and already chosen
To curule chairs the Sizii and Arrigucci.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-109">O how beheld I those who are undone
By their own pride! and how the Balls of Gold
Florence enflowered in all their mighty deeds!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-112">So likewise did the ancestors of those
Who evermore, when vacant is your church,
Fatten by staying in consistory.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-115">The insolent race, that like a dragon follows
Whoever flees, and unto him that shows
His teeth or purse is gentle as a lamb,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-118">Already rising was, but from low people;
So that it pleased not Ubertin Donato
That his wife's father should make him their kin.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-121">Already had Caponsacco to the Market
From Fesole descended, and already
Giuda and Infangato were good burghers.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-124">I'll tell a thing incredible, but true;
One entered the small circuit by a gate
Which from the Della Pera took its name!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-127">Each one that bears the beautiful escutcheon
Of the great baron whose renown and name
The festival of Thomas keepeth fresh,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-130">Knighthood and privilege from him received;
Though with the populace unites himself
To-day the man who binds it with a border.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-133">Already were Gualterotti and Importuni;
And still more quiet would the Borgo be
If with new neighbours it remained unfed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-136">The house from which is born your lamentation,
Through just disdain that death among you brought
And put an end unto your joyous life,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-139">Was honoured in itself and its companions.
O Buondelmonte, how in evil hour
Thou fled'st the bridal at another's promptings!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-142">Many would be rejoicing who are sad,
If God had thee surrendered to the Ema
The first time that thou camest to the city.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-145">But it behoved the mutilated stone
Which guards the bridge, that Florence should provide
A victim in her latest hour of peace.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-148">With all these families, and others with them,
Florence beheld I in so great repose,
That no occasion had she whence to weep;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-151">With all these families beheld so just
And glorious her people, that the lily
Never upon the spear was placed reversed,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvi-154">Nor by division was vermilion made."
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XVII

<p id="paradiso-xvii-1">As came to Clymene, to be made certain
Of that which he had heard against himself,
He who makes fathers chary still to children,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-4">Even such was I, and such was I perceived
By Beatrice and by the holy light
That first on my account had changed its place.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-7">Therefore my Lady said to me: "Send forth
The flame of thy desire, so that it issue
Imprinted well with the internal stamp;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-10">Not that our knowledge may be greater made
By speech of thine, but to accustom thee
To tell thy thirst, that we may give thee drink."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-13">"O my beloved tree, (that so dost lift thee,
That even as minds terrestrial perceive
No triangle containeth two obtuse,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-16">So thou beholdest the contingent things
Ere in themselves they are, fixing thine eyes
Upon the point in which all times are present,)
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-19">While I was with Virgilius conjoined
Upon the mountain that the souls doth heal,
And when descending into the dead world,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-22">Were spoken to me of my future life
Some grievous words; although I feel myself
In sooth foursquare against the blows of chance.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-25">On this account my wish would be content
To hear what fortune is approaching me,
Because foreseen an arrow comes more slowly."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-28">Thus did I say unto that selfsame light
That unto me had spoken before; and even
As Beatrice willed was my own will confessed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-31">Not in vague phrase, in which the foolish folk
Ensnared themselves of old, ere yet was slain
The Lamb of God who taketh sins away,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-34">But with clear words and unambiguous
Language responded that paternal love,
Hid and revealed by its own proper smile:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-37">"Contingency, that outside of the volume
Of your materiality extends not,
Is all depicted in the eternal aspect.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-40">Necessity however thence it takes not,
Except as from the eye, in which 'tis mirrored,
A ship that with the current down descends.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-43">From thence, e'en as there cometh to the ear
Sweet harmony from an organ, comes in sight
To me the time that is preparing for thee.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-46">As forth from Athens went Hippolytus,
By reason of his step-dame false and cruel,
So thou from Florence must perforce depart.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-49">Already this is willed, and this is sought for;
And soon it shall be done by him who thinks it,
Where every day the Christ is bought and sold.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-52">The blame shall follow the offended party
In outcry as is usual; but the vengeance
Shall witness to the truth that doth dispense it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-55">Thou shalt abandon everything beloved
Most tenderly, and this the arrow is
Which first the bow of banishment shoots forth.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-58">Thou shalt have proof how savoureth of salt
The bread of others, and how hard a road
The going down and up another's stairs.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-61">And that which most shall weigh upon thy shoulders
Will be the bad and foolish company
With which into this valley thou shalt fall;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-64">For all ingrate, all mad and impious
Will they become against thee; but soon after
They, and not thou, shall have the forehead scarlet.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-67">Of their bestiality their own proceedings
Shall furnish proof; so 'twill be well for thee
A party to have made thee by thyself.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-70">Thine earliest refuge and thine earliest inn
Shall be the mighty Lombard's courtesy,
Who on the Ladder bears the holy bird,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-73">Who such benign regard shall have for thee
That 'twixt you twain, in doing and in asking,
That shall be first which is with others last.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-76">With him shalt thou see one who at his birth
Has by this star of strength been so impressed,
That notable shall his achievements be.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-79">Not yet the people are aware of him
Through his young age, since only nine years yet
Around about him have these wheels revolved.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-82">But ere the Gascon cheat the noble Henry,
Some sparkles of his virtue shall appear
In caring not for silver nor for toil.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-85">So recognized shall his magnificence
Become hereafter, that his enemies
Will not have power to keep mute tongues about it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-88">On him rely, and on his benefits;
By him shall many people be transformed,
Changing condition rich and mendicant;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-91">And written in thy mind thou hence shalt bear
Of him, but shalt not say it"--and things said he
Incredible to those who shall be present.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-94">Then added: "Son, these are the commentaries
On what was said to thee; behold the snares
That are concealed behind few revolutions;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-97">Yet would I not thy neighbours thou shouldst envy,
Because thy life into the future reaches
Beyond the punishment of their perfidies."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-100">When by its silence showed that sainted soul
That it had finished putting in the woof
Into that web which I had given it warped,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-103">Began I, even as he who yearneth after,
Being in doubt, some counsel from a person
Who seeth, and uprightly wills, and loves:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-106">"Well see I, father mine, how spurreth on
The time towards me such a blow to deal me
As heaviest is to him who most gives way.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-109">Therefore with foresight it is well I arm me,
That, if the dearest place be taken from me,
I may not lose the others by my songs.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-112">Down through the world of infinite bitterness,
And o'er the mountain, from whose beauteous summit
The eyes of my own Lady lifted me,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-115">And afterward through heaven from light to light,
I have learned that which, if I tell again,
Will be a savour of strong herbs to many.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-118">And if I am a timid friend to truth,
I fear lest I may lose my life with those
Who will hereafter call this time the olden."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-121">The light in which was smiling my own treasure
Which there I had discovered, flashed at first
As in the sunshine doth a golden mirror;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-124">Then made reply: "A conscience overcast
Or with its own or with another's shame,
Will taste forsooth the tartness of thy word;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-127">But ne'ertheless, all falsehood laid aside,
Make manifest thy vision utterly,
And let them scratch wherever is the itch;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-130">For if thine utterance shall offensive be
At the first taste, a vital nutriment
'Twill leave thereafter, when it is digested.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-133">This cry of thine shall do as doth the wind,
Which smiteth most the most exalted summits,
And that is no slight argument of honour.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-136">Therefore are shown to thee within these wheels,
Upon the mount and in the dolorous valley,
Only the souls that unto fame are known;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-139">Because the spirit of the hearer rests not,
Nor doth confirm its faith by an example
Which has the root of it unknown and hidden,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xvii-142">Or other reason that is not apparent."
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XVIII

<p id="paradiso-xviii-1">Now was alone rejoicing in its word
That soul beatified, and I was tasting
My own, the bitter tempering with the sweet,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-4">And the Lady who to God was leading me
Said: "Change thy thought; consider that I am
Near unto Him who every wrong disburdens."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-7">Unto the loving accents of my comfort
I turned me round, and then what love I saw
Within those holy eyes I here relinquish;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-10">Not only that my language I distrust,
But that my mind cannot return so far
Above itself, unless another guide it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-13">Thus much upon that point can I repeat,
That, her again beholding, my affection
From every other longing was released.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-16">While the eternal pleasure, which direct
Rayed upon Beatrice, from her fair face
Contented me with its reflected aspect,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-19">Conquering me with the radiance of a smile,
She said to me, "Turn thee about and listen;
Not in mine eyes alone is Paradise."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-22">Even as sometimes here do we behold
The affection in the look, if it be such
That all the soul is wrapt away by it,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-25">So, by the flaming of the effulgence holy
To which I turned, I recognized therein
The wish of speaking to me somewhat farther.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-28">And it began: "In this fifth resting-place
Upon the tree that liveth by its summit,
And aye bears fruit, and never loses leaf,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-31">Are blessed spirits that below, ere yet
They came to Heaven, were of such great renown
That every Muse therewith would affluent be.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-34">Therefore look thou upon the cross's horns;
He whom I now shall name will there enact
What doth within a cloud its own swift fire."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-37">I saw athwart the Cross a splendour drawn
By naming Joshua, (even as he did it,)
Nor noted I the word before the deed;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-40">And at the name of the great Maccabee
I saw another move itself revolving,
And gladness was the whip unto that top.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-43">Likewise for Charlemagne and for Orlando,
Two of them my regard attentive followed
As followeth the eye its falcon flying.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-46">William thereafterward, and Renouard,
And the Duke Godfrey, did attract my sight
Along upon that Cross, and Robert Guiscard.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-49">Then, moved and mingled with the other lights,
The soul that had addressed me showed how great
An artist 'twas among the heavenly singers.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-52">To my right side I turned myself around,
My duty to behold in Beatrice
Either by words or gesture signified;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-55">And so translucent I beheld her eyes,
So full of pleasure, that her countenance
Surpassed its other and its latest wont.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-58">And as, by feeling greater delectation,
A man in doing good from day to day
Becomes aware his virtue is increasing,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-61">So I became aware that my gyration
With heaven together had increased its arc,
That miracle beholding more adorned.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-64">And such as is the change, in little lapse
Of time, in a pale woman, when her face
Is from the load of bashfulness unladen,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-67">Such was it in mine eyes, when I had turned,
Caused by the whiteness of the temperate star,
The sixth, which to itself had gathered me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-70">Within that Jovial torch did I behold
The sparkling of the love which was therein
Delineate our language to mine eyes.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-73">And even as birds uprisen from the shore,
As in congratulation o'er their food,
Make squadrons of themselves, now round, now long,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-76">So from within those lights the holy creatures
Sang flying to and fro, and in their figures
Made of themselves now D, now I, now L.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-79">First singing they to their own music moved;
Then one becoming of these characters,
A little while they rested and were silent.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-82">O divine Pegasea, thou who genius
Dost glorious make, and render it long-lived,
And this through thee the cities and the kingdoms,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-85">Illume me with thyself, that I may bring
Their figures out as I have them conceived!
Apparent be thy power in these brief verses!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-88">Themselves then they displayed in five times seven
Vowels and consonants; and I observed
The parts as they seemed spoken unto me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-91">'Diligite justitiam,' these were
First verb and noun of all that was depicted;
'Qui judicatis terram' were the last.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-94">Thereafter in the M of the fifth word
Remained they so arranged, that Jupiter
Seemed to be silver there with gold inlaid.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-97">And other lights I saw descend where was
The summit of the M, and pause there singing
The good, I think, that draws them to itself.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-100">Then, as in striking upon burning logs
Upward there fly innumerable sparks,
Whence fools are wont to look for auguries,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-103">More than a thousand lights seemed thence to rise,
And to ascend, some more, and others less,
Even as the Sun that lights them had allotted;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-106">And, each one being quiet in its place,
The head and neck beheld I of an eagle
Delineated by that inlaid fire.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-109">He who there paints has none to be his guide;
But Himself guides; and is from Him remembered
That virtue which is form unto the nest.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-112">The other beatitude, that contented seemed
At first to bloom a lily on the M,
By a slight motion followed out the imprint.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-115">O gentle star! what and how many gems
Did demonstrate to me, that all our justice
Effect is of that heaven which thou ingemmest!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-118">Wherefore I pray the Mind, in which begin
Thy motion and thy virtue, to regard
Whence comes the smoke that vitiates thy rays;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-121">So that a second time it now be wroth
With buying and with selling in the temple
Whose walls were built with signs and martyrdoms!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-124">O soldiery of heaven, whom I contemplate,
Implore for those who are upon the earth
All gone astray after the bad example!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-127">Once 'twas the custom to make war with swords;
But now 'tis made by taking here and there
The bread the pitying Father shuts from none.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-130">Yet thou, who writest but to cancel, think
That Peter and that Paul, who for this vineyard
Which thou art spoiling died, are still alive!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-133">Well canst thou say: "So steadfast my desire
Is unto him who willed to live alone,
And for a dance was led to martyrdom,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xviii-136">That I know not the Fisherman nor Paul."
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XIX

<p id="paradiso-xix-1">Appeared before me with its wings outspread
The beautiful image that in sweet fruition
Made jubilant the interwoven souls;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-4">Appeared a little ruby each, wherein
Ray of the sun was burning so enkindled
That each into mine eyes refracted it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-7">And what it now behoves me to retrace
Nor voice has e'er reported, nor ink written,
Nor was by fantasy e'er comprehended;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-10">For speak I saw, and likewise heard, the beak,
And utter with its voice both 'I' and 'My,'
When in conception it was 'We' and 'Our.'
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-13">And it began: "Being just and merciful
Am I exalted here unto that glory
Which cannot be exceeded by desire;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-16">And upon earth I left my memory
Such, that the evil-minded people there
Commend it, but continue not the story."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-19">So doth a single heat from many embers
Make itself felt, even as from many loves
Issued a single sound from out that image.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-22">Whence I thereafter: "O perpetual flowers
Of the eternal joy, that only one
Make me perceive your odours manifold,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-25">Exhaling, break within me the great fast
Which a long season has in hunger held me,
Not finding for it any food on earth.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-28">Well do I know, that if in heaven its mirror
Justice Divine another realm doth make,
Yours apprehends it not through any veil.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-31">You know how I attentively address me
To listen; and you know what is the doubt
That is in me so very old a fast."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-34">Even as a falcon, issuing from his hood,
Doth move his head, and with his wings applaud him,
Showing desire, and making himself fine,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-37">Saw I become that standard, which of lauds
Was interwoven of the grace divine,
With such songs as he knows who there rejoices.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-40">Then it began: "He who a compass turned
On the world's outer verge, and who within it
Devised so much occult and manifest,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-43">Could not the impress of his power so make
On all the universe, as that his Word
Should not remain in infinite excess.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-46">And this makes certain that the first proud being,
Who was the paragon of every creature,
By not awaiting light fell immature.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-49">And hence appears it, that each minor nature
Is scant receptacle unto that good
Which has no end, and by itself is measured.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-52">In consequence our vision, which perforce
Must be some ray of that intelligence
With which all things whatever are replete,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-55">Cannot in its own nature be so potent,
That it shall not its origin discern
Far beyond that which is apparent to it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-58">Therefore into the justice sempiternal
The power of vision that your world receives,
As eye into the ocean, penetrates;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-61">Which, though it see the bottom near the shore,
Upon the deep perceives it not, and yet
'Tis there, but it is hidden by the depth.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-64">There is no light but comes from the serene
That never is o'ercast, nay, it is darkness
Or shadow of the flesh, or else its poison.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-67">Amply to thee is opened now the cavern
Which has concealed from thee the living justice
Of which thou mad'st such frequent questioning.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-70">For saidst thou: 'Born a man is on the shore
Of Indus, and is none who there can speak
Of Christ, nor who can read, nor who can write;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-73">And all his inclinations and his actions
Are good, so far as human reason sees,
Without a sin in life or in discourse:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-76">He dieth unbaptised and without faith;
Where is this justice that condemneth him?
Where is his fault, if he do not believe?'
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-79">Now who art thou, that on the bench wouldst sit
In judgment at a thousand miles away,
With the short vision of a single span?
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-82">Truly to him who with me subtilizes,
If so the Scripture were not over you,
For doubting there were marvellous occasion.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-85">O animals terrene, O stolid minds,
The primal will, that in itself is good,
Ne'er from itself, the Good Supreme, has moved.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-88">So much is just as is accordant with it;
No good created draws it to itself,
But it, by raying forth, occasions that."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-91">Even as above her nest goes circling round
The stork when she has fed her little ones,
And he who has been fed looks up at her,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-94">So lifted I my brows, and even such
Became the blessed image, which its wings
Was moving, by so many counsels urged.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-97">Circling around it sang, and said: "As are
My notes to thee, who dost not comprehend them,
Such is the eternal judgment to you mortals."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-100">Those lucent splendours of the Holy Spirit
Grew quiet then, but still within the standard
That made the Romans reverend to the world.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-103">It recommenced: "Unto this kingdom never
Ascended one who had not faith in Christ,
Before or since he to the tree was nailed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-106">But look thou, many crying are, 'Christ, Christ!'
Who at the judgment shall be far less near
To him than some shall be who knew not Christ.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-109">Such Christians shall the Ethiop condemn,
When the two companies shall be divided,
The one for ever rich, the other poor.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-112">What to your kings may not the Persians say,
When they that volume opened shall behold
In which are written down all their dispraises?
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-115">There shall be seen, among the deeds of Albert,
That which ere long shall set the pen in motion,
For which the realm of Prague shall be deserted.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-118">There shall be seen the woe that on the Seine
He brings by falsifying of the coin,
Who by the blow of a wild boar shall die.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-121">There shall be seen the pride that causes thirst,
Which makes the Scot and Englishman so mad
That they within their boundaries cannot rest;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-124">Be seen the luxury and effeminate life
Of him of Spain, and the Bohemian,
Who valour never knew and never wished;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-127">Be seen the Cripple of Jerusalem,
His goodness represented by an I,
While the reverse an M shall represent;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-130">Be seen the avarice and poltroonery
Of him who guards the Island of the Fire,
Wherein Anchises finished his long life;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-133">And to declare how pitiful he is
Shall be his record in contracted letters
Which shall make note of much in little space.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-136">And shall appear to each one the foul deeds
Of uncle and of brother who a nation
So famous have dishonoured, and two crowns.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-139">And he of Portugal and he of Norway
Shall there be known, and he of Rascia too,
Who saw in evil hour the coin of Venice.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-142">O happy Hungary, if she let herself
Be wronged no farther! and Navarre the happy,
If with the hills that gird her she be armed!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-145">And each one may believe that now, as hansel
Thereof, do Nicosia and Famagosta
Lament and rage because of their own beast,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xix-148">Who from the others' flank departeth not."
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XX

<p id="paradiso-xx-1">When he who all the world illuminates
Out of our hemisphere so far descends
That on all sides the daylight is consumed,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-4">The heaven, that erst by him alone was kindled,
Doth suddenly reveal itself again
By many lights, wherein is one resplendent.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-7">And came into my mind this act of heaven,
When the ensign of the world and of its leaders
Had silent in the blessed beak become;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-10">Because those living luminaries all,
By far more luminous, did songs begin
Lapsing and falling from my memory.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-13">O gentle Love, that with a smile dost cloak thee,
How ardent in those sparks didst thou appear,
That had the breath alone of holy thoughts!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-16">After the precious and pellucid crystals,
With which begemmed the sixth light I beheld,
Silence imposed on the angelic bells,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-19">I seemed to hear the murmuring of a river
That clear descendeth down from rock to rock,
Showing the affluence of its mountain-top.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-22">And as the sound upon the cithern's neck
Taketh its form, and as upon the vent
Of rustic pipe the wind that enters it,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-25">Even thus, relieved from the delay of waiting,
That murmuring of the eagle mounted up
Along its neck, as if it had been hollow.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-28">There it became a voice, and issued thence
From out its beak, in such a form of words
As the heart waited for wherein I wrote them.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-31">"The part in me which sees and bears the sun
In mortal eagles," it began to me,
"Now fixedly must needs be looked upon;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-34">For of the fires of which I make my figure,
Those whence the eye doth sparkle in my head
Of all their orders the supremest are.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-37">He who is shining in the midst as pupil
Was once the singer of the Holy Spirit,
Who bore the ark from city unto city;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-40">Now knoweth he the merit of his song,
In so far as effect of his own counsel,
By the reward which is commensurate.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-43">Of five, that make a circle for my brow,
He that approacheth nearest to my beak
Did the poor widow for her son console;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-46">Now knoweth he how dearly it doth cost
Not following Christ, by the experience
Of this sweet life and of its opposite.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-49">He who comes next in the circumference
Of which I speak, upon its highest arc,
Did death postpone by penitence sincere;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-52">Now knoweth he that the eternal judgment
Suffers no change, albeit worthy prayer
Maketh below to-morrow of to-day.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-55">The next who follows, with the laws and me,
Under the good intent that bore bad fruit
Became a Greek by ceding to the pastor;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-58">Now knoweth he how all the ill deduced
From his good action is not harmful to him,
Although the world thereby may be destroyed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-61">And he, whom in the downward arc thou seest,
Guglielmo was, whom the same land deplores
That weepeth Charles and Frederick yet alive;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-64">Now knoweth he how heaven enamoured is
With a just king; and in the outward show
Of his effulgence he reveals it still.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-67">Who would believe, down in the errant world,
That e'er the Trojan Ripheus in this round
Could be the fifth one of the holy lights?
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-70">Now knoweth he enough of what the world
Has not the power to see of grace divine,
Although his sight may not discern the bottom."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-73">Like as a lark that in the air expatiates,
First singing and then silent with content
Of the last sweetness that doth satisfy her,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-76">Such seemed to me the image of the imprint
Of the eternal pleasure, by whose will
Doth everything become the thing it is.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-79">And notwithstanding to my doubt I was
As glass is to the colour that invests it,
To wait the time in silence it endured not,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-82">But forth from out my mouth, "What things are these?"
Extorted with the force of its own weight;
Whereat I saw great joy of coruscation.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-85">Thereafterward with eye still more enkindled
The blessed standard made to me reply,
To keep me not in wonderment suspended:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-88">"I see that thou believest in these things
Because I say them, but thou seest not how;
So that, although believed in, they are hidden.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-91">Thou doest as he doth who a thing by name
Well apprehendeth, but its quiddity
Cannot perceive, unless another show it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-94">'Regnum coelorum' suffereth violence
From fervent love, and from that living hope
That overcometh the Divine volition;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-97">Not in the guise that man o'ercometh man,
But conquers it because it will be conquered,
And conquered conquers by benignity.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-100">The first life of the eyebrow and the fifth
Cause thee astonishment, because with them
Thou seest the region of the angels painted.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-103">They passed not from their bodies, as thou thinkest,
Gentiles, but Christians in the steadfast faith
Of feet that were to suffer and had suffered.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-106">For one from Hell, where no one e'er turns back
Unto good will, returned unto his bones,
And that of living hope was the reward,--
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-109">Of living hope, that placed its efficacy
In prayers to God made to resuscitate him,
So that 'twere possible to move his will.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-112">The glorious soul concerning which I speak,
Returning to the flesh, where brief its stay,
Believed in Him who had the power to aid it;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-115">And, in believing, kindled to such fire
Of genuine love, that at the second death
Worthy it was to come unto this joy.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-118">The other one, through grace, that from so deep
A fountain wells that never hath the eye
Of any creature reached its primal wave,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-121">Set all his love below on righteousness;
Wherefore from grace to grace did God unclose
His eye to our redemption yet to be,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-124">Whence he believed therein, and suffered not
From that day forth the stench of paganism,
And he reproved therefor the folk perverse.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-127">Those Maidens three, whom at the right-hand wheel
Thou didst behold, were unto him for baptism
More than a thousand years before baptizing.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-130">O thou predestination, how remote
Thy root is from the aspect of all those
Who the First Cause do not behold entire!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-133">And you, O mortals! hold yourselves restrained
In judging; for ourselves, who look on God,
We do not know as yet all the elect;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-136">And sweet to us is such a deprivation,
Because our good in this good is made perfect,
That whatsoe'er God wills, we also will."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-139">After this manner by that shape divine,
To make clear in me my short-sightedness,
Was given to me a pleasant medicine;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-142">And as good singer a good lutanist
Accompanies with vibrations of the chords,
Whereby more pleasantness the song acquires,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-145">So, while it spake, do I remember me
That I beheld both of those blessed lights,
Even as the winking of the eyes concords,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xx-148">Moving unto the words their little flames.
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XXI

<p id="paradiso-xxi-1">Already on my Lady's face mine eyes
Again were fastened, and with these my mind,
And from all other purpose was withdrawn;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-4">And she smiled not; but "If I were to smile,"
She unto me began, "thou wouldst become
Like Semele, when she was turned to ashes.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-7">Because my beauty, that along the stairs
Of the eternal palace more enkindles,
As thou hast seen, the farther we ascend,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-10">If it were tempered not, is so resplendent
That all thy mortal power in its effulgence
Would seem a leaflet that the thunder crushes.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-13">We are uplifted to the seventh splendour,
That underneath the burning Lion's breast
Now radiates downward mingled with his power.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-16">Fix in direction of thine eyes the mind,
And make of them a mirror for the figure
That in this mirror shall appear to thee."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-19">He who could know what was the pasturage
My sight had in that blessed countenance,
When I transferred me to another care,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-22">Would recognize how grateful was to me
Obedience unto my celestial escort,
By counterpoising one side with the other.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-25">Within the crystal which, around the world
Revolving, bears the name of its dear leader,
Under whom every wickedness lay dead,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-28">Coloured like gold, on which the sunshine gleams,
A stairway I beheld to such a height
Uplifted, that mine eye pursued it not.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-31">Likewise beheld I down the steps descending
So many splendours, that I thought each light
That in the heaven appears was there diffused.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-34">And as accordant with their natural custom
The rooks together at the break of day
Bestir themselves to warm their feathers cold;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-37">Then some of them fly off without return,
Others come back to where they started from,
And others, wheeling round, still keep at home;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-40">Such fashion it appeared to me was there
Within the sparkling that together came,
As soon as on a certain step it struck,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-43">And that which nearest unto us remained
Became so clear, that in my thought I said,
"Well I perceive the love thou showest me;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-46">But she, from whom I wait the how and when
Of speech and silence, standeth still; whence I
Against desire do well if I ask not."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-49">She thereupon, who saw my silentness
In the sight of Him who seeth everything,
Said unto me, "Let loose thy warm desire."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-52">And I began: "No merit of my own
Renders me worthy of response from thee;
But for her sake who granteth me the asking,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-55">Thou blessed life that dost remain concealed
In thy beatitude, make known to me
The cause which draweth thee so near my side;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-58">And tell me why is silent in this wheel
The dulcet symphony of Paradise,
That through the rest below sounds so devoutly."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-61">"Thou hast thy hearing mortal as thy sight,"
It answer made to me; "they sing not here,
For the same cause that Beatrice has not smiled.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-64">Thus far adown the holy stairway's steps
Have I descended but to give thee welcome
With words, and with the light that mantles me;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-67">Nor did more love cause me to be more ready,
For love as much and more up there is burning,
As doth the flaming manifest to thee.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-70">But the high charity, that makes us servants
Prompt to the counsel which controls the world,
Allotteth here, even as thou dost observe."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-73">"I see full well," said I, "O sacred lamp!
How love unfettered in this court sufficeth
To follow the eternal Providence;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-76">But this is what seems hard for me to see,
Wherefore predestinate wast thou alone
Unto this office from among thy consorts."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-79">No sooner had I come to the last word,
Than of its middle made the light a centre,
Whirling itself about like a swift millstone.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-82">When answer made the love that was therein:
"On me directed is a light divine,
Piercing through this in which I am embosomed,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-85">Of which the virtue with my sight conjoined
Lifts me above myself so far, I see
The supreme essence from which this is drawn.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-88">Hence comes the joyfulness with which I flame,
For to my sight, as far as it is clear,
The clearness of the flame I equal make.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-91">But that soul in the heaven which is most pure,
That seraph which his eye on God most fixes,
Could this demand of thine not satisfy;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-94">Because so deeply sinks in the abyss
Of the eternal statute what thou askest,
From all created sight it is cut off.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-97">And to the mortal world, when thou returnest,
This carry back, that it may not presume
Longer tow'rd such a goal to move its feet.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-100">The mind, that shineth here, on earth doth smoke;
From this observe how can it do below
That which it cannot though the heaven assume it?"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-103">Such limit did its words prescribe to me,
The question I relinquished, and restricted
Myself to ask it humbly who it was.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-106">"Between two shores of Italy rise cliffs,
And not far distant from thy native place,
So high, the thunders far below them sound,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-109">And form a ridge that Catria is called,
'Neath which is consecrate a hermitage
Wont to be dedicate to worship only."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-112">Thus unto me the third speech recommenced,
And then, continuing, it said: "Therein
Unto God's service I became so steadfast,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-115">That feeding only on the juice of olives
Lightly I passed away the heats and frosts,
Contented in my thoughts contemplative.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-118">That cloister used to render to these heavens
Abundantly, and now is empty grown,
So that perforce it soon must be revealed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-121">I in that place was Peter Damiano;
And Peter the Sinner was I in the house
Of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-124">Little of mortal life remained to me,
When I was called and dragged forth to the hat
Which shifteth evermore from bad to worse.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-127">Came Cephas, and the mighty Vessel came
Of the Holy Spirit, meagre and barefooted,
Taking the food of any hostelry.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-130">Now some one to support them on each side
The modern shepherds need, and some to lead them,
So heavy are they, and to hold their trains.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-133">They cover up their palfreys with their cloaks,
So that two beasts go underneath one skin;
O Patience, that dost tolerate so much!"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-136">At this voice saw I many little flames
From step to step descending and revolving,
And every revolution made them fairer.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-139">Round about this one came they and stood still,
And a cry uttered of so loud a sound,
It here could find no parallel, nor I
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxi-142">Distinguished it, the thunder so o'ercame me.
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XXII

<p id="paradiso-xxii-1">Oppressed with stupor, I unto my guide
Turned like a little child who always runs
For refuge there where he confideth most;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-4">And she, even as a mother who straightway
Gives comfort to her pale and breathless boy
With voice whose wont it is to reassure him,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-7">Said to me: "Knowest thou not thou art in heaven,
And knowest thou not that heaven is holy all
And what is done here cometh from good zeal?
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-10">After what wise the singing would have changed thee
And I by smiling, thou canst now imagine,
Since that the cry has startled thee so much,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-13">In which if thou hadst understood its prayers
Already would be known to thee the vengeance
Which thou shalt look upon before thou diest.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-16">The sword above here smiteth not in haste
Nor tardily, howe'er it seem to him
Who fearing or desiring waits for it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-19">But turn thee round towards the others now,
For very illustrious spirits shalt thou see,
If thou thy sight directest as I say."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-22">As it seemed good to her mine eyes I turned,
And saw a hundred spherules that together
With mutual rays each other more embellished.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-25">I stood as one who in himself represses
The point of his desire, and ventures not
To question, he so feareth the too much.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-28">And now the largest and most luculent
Among those pearls came forward, that it might
Make my desire concerning it content.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-31">Within it then I heard: "If thou couldst see
Even as myself the charity that burns
Among us, thy conceits would be expressed;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-34">But, that by waiting thou mayst not come late
To the high end, I will make answer even
Unto the thought of which thou art so chary.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-37">That mountain on whose slope Cassino stands
Was frequented of old upon its summit
By a deluded folk and ill-disposed;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-40">And I am he who first up thither bore
The name of Him who brought upon the earth
The truth that so much sublimateth us.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-43">And such abundant grace upon me shone
That all the neighbouring towns I drew away
From the impious worship that seduced the world.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-46">These other fires, each one of them, were men
Contemplative, enkindled by that heat
Which maketh holy flowers and fruits spring up.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-49">Here is Macarius, here is Romualdus,
Here are my brethren, who within the cloisters
Their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-52">And I to him: "The affection which thou showest
Speaking with me, and the good countenance
Which I behold and note in all your ardours,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-55">In me have so my confidence dilated
As the sun doth the rose, when it becomes
As far unfolded as it hath the power.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-58">Therefore I pray, and thou assure me, father,
If I may so much grace receive, that I
May thee behold with countenance unveiled."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-61">He thereupon: "Brother, thy high desire
In the remotest sphere shall be fulfilled,
Where are fulfilled all others and my own.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-64">There perfect is, and ripened, and complete,
Every desire; within that one alone
Is every part where it has always been;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-67">For it is not in space, nor turns on poles,
And unto it our stairway reaches up,
Whence thus from out thy sight it steals away.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-70">Up to that height the Patriarch Jacob saw it
Extending its supernal part, what time
So thronged with angels it appeared to him.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-73">But to ascend it now no one uplifts
His feet from off the earth, and now my Rule
Below remaineth for mere waste of paper.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-76">The walls that used of old to be an Abbey
Are changed to dens of robbers, and the cowls
Are sacks filled full of miserable flour.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-79">But heavy usury is not taken up
So much against God's pleasure as that fruit
Which maketh so insane the heart of monks;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-82">For whatsoever hath the Church in keeping
Is for the folk that ask it in God's name,
Not for one's kindred or for something worse.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-85">The flesh of mortals is so very soft,
That good beginnings down below suffice not
From springing of the oak to bearing acorns.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-88">Peter began with neither gold nor silver,
And I with orison and abstinence,
And Francis with humility his convent.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-91">And if thou lookest at each one's beginning,
And then regardest whither he has run,
Thou shalt behold the white changed into brown.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-94">In verity the Jordan backward turned,
And the sea's fleeing, when God willed were more
A wonder to behold, than succour here."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-97">Thus unto me he said; and then withdrew
To his own band, and the band closed together;
Then like a whirlwind all was upward rapt.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-100">The gentle Lady urged me on behind them
Up o'er that stairway by a single sign,
So did her virtue overcome my nature;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-103">Nor here below, where one goes up and down
By natural law, was motion e'er so swift
That it could be compared unto my wing.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-106">Reader, as I may unto that devout
Triumph return, on whose account I often
For my transgressions weep and beat my breast,--
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-109">Thou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire
And drawn it out again, before I saw
The sign that follows Taurus, and was in it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-112">O glorious stars, O light impregnated
With mighty virtue, from which I acknowledge
All of my genius, whatsoe'er it be,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-115">With you was born, and hid himself with you,
He who is father of all mortal life,
When first I tasted of the Tuscan air;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-118">And then when grace was freely given to me
To enter the high wheel which turns you round,
Your region was allotted unto me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-121">To you devoutly at this hour my soul
Is sighing, that it virtue may acquire
For the stern pass that draws it to itself.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-124">"Thou art so near unto the last salvation,"
Thus Beatrice began, "thou oughtest now
To have thine eves unclouded and acute;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-127">And therefore, ere thou enter farther in,
Look down once more, and see how vast a world
Thou hast already put beneath thy feet;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-130">So that thy heart, as jocund as it may,
Present itself to the triumphant throng
That comes rejoicing through this rounded ether."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-133">I with my sight returned through one and all
The sevenfold spheres, and I beheld this globe
Such that I smiled at its ignoble semblance;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-136">And that opinion I approve as best
Which doth account it least; and he who thinks
Of something else may truly be called just.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-139">I saw the daughter of Latona shining
Without that shadow, which to me was cause
That once I had believed her rare and dense.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-142">The aspect of thy son, Hyperion,
Here I sustained, and saw how move themselves
Around and near him Maia and Dione.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-145">Thence there appeared the temperateness of Jove
'Twixt son and father, and to me was clear
The change that of their whereabout they make;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-148">And all the seven made manifest to me
How great they are, and eke how swift they are,
And how they are in distant habitations.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-151">The threshing-floor that maketh us so proud,
To me revolving with the eternal Twins,
Was all apparent made from hill to harbour!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxii-154">Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes I turned.
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XXIII

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-1">Even as a bird, 'mid the beloved leaves,
Quiet upon the nest of her sweet brood
Throughout the night, that hideth all things from us,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-4">Who, that she may behold their longed-for looks
And find the food wherewith to nourish them,
In which, to her, grave labours grateful are,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-7">Anticipates the time on open spray
And with an ardent longing waits the sun,
Gazing intent as soon as breaks the dawn:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-10">Even thus my Lady standing was, erect
And vigilant, turned round towards the zone
Underneath which the sun displays less haste;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-13">So that beholding her distraught and wistful,
Such I became as he is who desiring
For something yearns, and hoping is appeased.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-16">But brief the space from one When to the other;
Of my awaiting, say I, and the seeing
The welkin grow resplendent more and more.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-19">And Beatrice exclaimed: "Behold the hosts
Of Christ's triumphal march, and all the fruit
Harvested by the rolling of these spheres!"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-22">It seemed to me her face was all aflame;
And eyes she had so full of ecstasy
That I must needs pass on without describing.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-25">As when in nights serene of the full moon
Smiles Trivia among the nymphs eternal
Who paint the firmament through all its gulfs,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-28">Saw I, above the myriads of lamps,
A Sun that one and all of them enkindled,
E'en as our own doth the supernal sights,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-31">And through the living light transparent shone
The lucent substance so intensely clear
Into my sight, that I sustained it not.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-34">O Beatrice, thou gentle guide and dear!
To me she said: "What overmasters thee
A virtue is from which naught shields itself.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-37">There are the wisdom and the omnipotence
That oped the thoroughfares 'twixt heaven and earth,
For which there erst had been so long a yearning."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-40">As fire from out a cloud unlocks itself,
Dilating so it finds not room therein,
And down, against its nature, falls to earth,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-43">So did my mind, among those aliments
Becoming larger, issue from itself,
And that which it became cannot remember.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-46">"Open thine eyes, and look at what I am:
Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough
Hast thou become to tolerate my smile."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-49">I was as one who still retains the feeling
Of a forgotten vision, and endeavours
In vain to bring it back into his mind,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-52">When I this invitation heard, deserving
Of so much gratitude, it never fades
Out of the book that chronicles the past.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-55">If at this moment sounded all the tongues
That Polyhymnia and her sisters made
Most lubrical with their delicious milk,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-58">To aid me, to a thousandth of the truth
It would not reach, singing the holy smile
And how the holy aspect it illumed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-61">And therefore, representing Paradise,
The sacred poem must perforce leap over,
Even as a man who finds his way cut off;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-64">But whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme,
And of the mortal shoulder laden with it,
Should blame it not, if under this it tremble.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-67">It is no passage for a little boat
This which goes cleaving the audacious prow,
Nor for a pilot who would spare himself.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-70">"Why doth my face so much enamour thee,
That to the garden fair thou turnest not,
Which under the rays of Christ is blossoming?
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-73">There is the Rose in which the Word Divine
Became incarnate; there the lilies are
By whose perfume the good way was discovered."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-76">Thus Beatrice; and I, who to her counsels
Was wholly ready, once again betook me
Unto the battle of the feeble brows.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-79">As in the sunshine, that unsullied streams
Through fractured cloud, ere now a meadow of flowers
Mine eyes with shadow covered o'er have seen,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-82">So troops of splendours manifold I saw
Illumined from above with burning rays,
Beholding not the source of the effulgence.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-85">O power benignant that dost so imprint them!
Thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope
There to mine eyes, that were not strong enough.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-88">The name of that fair flower I e'er invoke
Morning and evening utterly enthralled
My soul to gaze upon the greater fire.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-91">And when in both mine eyes depicted were
The glory and greatness of the living star
Which there excelleth, as it here excelled,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-94">Athwart the heavens a little torch descended
Formed in a circle like a coronal,
And cinctured it, and whirled itself about it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-97">Whatever melody most sweetly soundeth
On earth, and to itself most draws the soul,
Would seem a cloud that, rent asunder, thunders,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-100">Compared unto the sounding of that lyre
Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful,
Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-103">"I am Angelic Love, that circle round
The joy sublime which breathes from out the womb
That was the hostelry of our Desire;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-106">And I shall circle, Lady of Heaven, while
Thou followest thy Son, and mak'st diviner
The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-109">Thus did the circulated melody
Seal itself up; and all the other lights
Were making to resound the name of Mary.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-112">The regal mantle of the volumes all
Of that world, which most fervid is and living
With breath of God and with his works and ways,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-115">Extended over us its inner border,
So very distant, that the semblance of it
There where I was not yet appeared to me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-118">Therefore mine eyes did not possess the power
Of following the incoronated flame,
Which mounted upward near to its own seed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-121">And as a little child, that towards its mother
Stretches its arms, when it the milk has taken,
Through impulse kindled into outward flame,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-124">Each of those gleams of whiteness upward reached
So with its summit, that the deep affection
They had for Mary was revealed to me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-127">Thereafter they remained there in my sight,
'Regina coeli' singing with such sweetness,
That ne'er from me has the delight departed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-130">O, what exuberance is garnered up
Within those richest coffers, which had been
Good husbandmen for sowing here below!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-133">There they enjoy and live upon the treasure
Which was acquired while weeping in the exile
Of Babylon, wherein the gold was left.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-136">There triumpheth, beneath the exalted Son
Of God and Mary, in his victory,
Both with the ancient council and the new,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiii-139">He who doth keep the keys of such a glory.

## Paradiso - Canto XXIV

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-1">"O company elect to the great supper
Of the Lamb benedight, who feedeth you
So that for ever full is your desire,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-4">If by the grace of God this man foretaste
Something of that which falleth from your table,
Or ever death prescribe to him the time,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-7">Direct your mind to his immense desire,
And him somewhat bedew; ye drinking are
For ever at the fount whence comes his thought."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-10">Thus Beatrice; and those souls beatified
Transformed themselves to spheres on steadfast poles,
Flaming intensely in the guise of comets.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-13">And as the wheels in works of horologes
Revolve so that the first to the beholder
Motionless seems, and the last one to fly,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-16">So in like manner did those carols, dancing
In different measure, of their affluence
Give me the gauge, as they were swift or slow.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-19">From that one which I noted of most beauty
Beheld I issue forth a fire so happy
That none it left there of a greater brightness;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-22">And around Beatrice three several times
It whirled itself with so divine a song,
My fantasy repeats it not to me;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-25">Therefore the pen skips, and I write it not,
Since our imagination for such folds,
Much more our speech, is of a tint too glaring.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-28">"O holy sister mine, who us implorest
With such devotion, by thine ardent love
Thou dost unbind me from that beautiful sphere!"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-31">Thereafter, having stopped, the blessed fire
Unto my Lady did direct its breath,
Which spake in fashion as I here have said.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-34">And she: "O light eterne of the great man
To whom our Lord delivered up the keys
He carried down of this miraculous joy,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-37">This one examine on points light and grave,
As good beseemeth thee, about the Faith
By means of which thou on the sea didst walk.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-40">If he love well, and hope well, and believe,
From thee 'tis hid not; for thou hast thy sight
There where depicted everything is seen.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-43">But since this kingdom has made citizens
By means of the true Faith, to glorify it
'Tis well he have the chance to speak thereof."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-46">As baccalaureate arms himself, and speaks not
Until the master doth propose the question,
To argue it, and not to terminate it,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-49">So did I arm myself with every reason,
While she was speaking, that I might be ready
For such a questioner and such profession.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-52">"Say, thou good Christian; manifest thyself;
What is the Faith?"  Whereat I raised my brow
Unto that light wherefrom was this breathed forth.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-55">Then turned I round to Beatrice, and she
Prompt signals made to me that I should pour
The water forth from my internal fountain.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-58">"May grace, that suffers me to make confession,"
Began I, "to the great centurion,
Cause my conceptions all to be explicit!"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-61">And I continued: "As the truthful pen,
Father, of thy dear brother wrote of it,
Who put with thee Rome into the good way,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-64">Faith is the substance of the things we hope for,
And evidence of those that are not seen;
And this appears to me its quiddity."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-67">Then heard I: "Very rightly thou perceivest,
If well thou understandest why he placed it
With substances and then with evidences."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-70">And I thereafterward: "The things profound,
That here vouchsafe to me their apparition,
Unto all eyes below are so concealed,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-73">That they exist there only in belief,
Upon the which is founded the high hope,
And hence it takes the nature of a substance.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-76">And it behoveth us from this belief
To reason without having other sight,
And hence it has the nature of evidence."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-79">Then heard I: "If whatever is acquired
Below by doctrine were thus understood,
No sophist's subtlety would there find place."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-82">Thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love;
Then added: "Very well has been gone over
Already of this coin the alloy and weight;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-85">But tell me if thou hast it in thy purse?"
And I: "Yes, both so shining and so round
That in its stamp there is no peradventure."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-88">Thereafter issued from the light profound
That there resplendent was: "This precious jewel,
Upon the which is every virtue founded,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-91">Whence hadst thou it?"  And I: "The large outpouring
Of Holy Spirit, which has been diffused
Upon the ancient parchments and the new,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-94">A syllogism is, which proved it to me
With such acuteness, that, compared therewith,
All demonstration seems to me obtuse."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-97">And then I heard: "The ancient and the new
Postulates, that to thee are so conclusive,
Why dost thou take them for the word divine?"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-100">And I: "The proofs, which show the truth to me,
Are the works subsequent, whereunto Nature
Ne'er heated iron yet, nor anvil beat."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-103">'Twas answered me: "Say, who assureth thee
That those works ever were? the thing itself
That must be proved, nought else to thee affirms it."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-106">"Were the world to Christianity converted,"
I said, "withouten miracles, this one
Is such, the rest are not its hundredth part;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-109">Because that poor and fasting thou didst enter
Into the field to sow there the good plant,
Which was a vine and has become a thorn!"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-112">This being finished, the high, holy Court
Resounded through the spheres, "One God we praise!"
In melody that there above is chanted.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-115">And then that Baron, who from branch to branch,
Examining, had thus conducted me,
Till the extremest leaves we were approaching,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-118">Again began: "The Grace that dallying
Plays with thine intellect thy mouth has opened,
Up to this point, as it should opened be,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-121">So that I do approve what forth emerged;
But now thou must express what thou believest,
And whence to thy belief it was presented."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-124">"O holy father, spirit who beholdest
What thou believedst so that thou o'ercamest,
Towards the sepulchre, more youthful feet,"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-127">Began I, "thou dost wish me in this place
The form to manifest of my prompt belief,
And likewise thou the cause thereof demandest.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-130">And I respond: In one God I believe,
Sole and eterne, who moveth all the heavens
With love and with desire, himself unmoved;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-133">And of such faith not only have I proofs
Physical and metaphysical, but gives them
Likewise the truth that from this place rains down
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-136">Through Moses, through the Prophets and the Psalms,
Through the Evangel, and through you, who wrote
After the fiery Spirit sanctified you;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-139">In Persons three eterne believe, and these
One essence I believe, so one and trine
They bear conjunction both with 'sunt' and 'est.'
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-142">With the profound condition and divine
Which now I touch upon, doth stamp my mind
Ofttimes the doctrine evangelical.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-145">This the beginning is, this is the spark
Which afterwards dilates to vivid flame,
And, like a star in heaven, is sparkling in me."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-148">Even as a lord who hears what pleaseth him
His servant straight embraces, gratulating
For the good news as soon as he is silent;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-151">So, giving me its benediction, singing,
Three times encircled me, when I was silent,
The apostolic light, at whose command
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxiv-154">I spoken had, in speaking I so pleased him.
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XXV

<p id="paradiso-xxv-1">If e'er it happen that the Poem Sacred,
To which both heaven and earth have set their hand,
So that it many a year hath made me lean,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-4">O'ercome the cruelty that bars me out
From the fair sheepfold, where a lamb I slumbered,
An enemy to the wolves that war upon it,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-7">With other voice forthwith, with other fleece
Poet will I return, and at my font
Baptismal will I take the laurel crown;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-10">Because into the Faith that maketh known
All souls to God there entered I, and then
Peter for her sake thus my brow encircled.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-13">Thereafterward towards us moved a light
Out of that band whence issued the first-fruits
Which of his vicars Christ behind him left,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-16">And then my Lady, full of ecstasy,
Said unto me: "Look, look! behold the Baron
For whom below Galicia is frequented."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-19">In the same way as, when a dove alights
Near his companion, both of them pour forth,
Circling about and murmuring, their affection,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-22">So one beheld I by the other grand
Prince glorified to be with welcome greeted,
Lauding the food that there above is eaten.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-25">But when their gratulations were complete,
Silently 'coram me' each one stood still,
So incandescent it o'ercame my sight.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-28">Smiling thereafterwards, said Beatrice:
"Illustrious life, by whom the benefactions
Of our Basilica have been described,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-31">Make Hope resound within this altitude;
Thou knowest as oft thou dost personify it
As Jesus to the three gave greater clearness."--
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-34">"Lift up thy head, and make thyself assured;
For what comes hither from the mortal world
Must needs be ripened in our radiance."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-37">This comfort came to me from the second fire;
Wherefore mine eyes I lifted to the hills,
Which bent them down before with too great weight.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-40">"Since, through his grace, our Emperor wills that thou
Shouldst find thee face to face, before thy death,
In the most secret chamber, with his Counts,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-43">So that, the truth beholden of this court,
Hope, which below there rightfully enamours,
Thereby thou strengthen in thyself and others,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-46">Say what it is, and how is flowering with it
Thy mind, and say from whence it came to thee."
Thus did the second light again continue.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-49">And the Compassionate, who piloted
The plumage of my wings in such high flight,
Did in reply anticipate me thus:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-52">"No child whatever the Church Militant
Of greater hope possesses, as is written
In that Sun which irradiates all our band;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-55">Therefore it is conceded him from Egypt
To come into Jerusalem to see,
Or ever yet his warfare be completed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-58">The two remaining points, that not for knowledge
Have been demanded, but that he report
How much this virtue unto thee is pleasing,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-61">To him I leave; for hard he will not find them,
Nor of self-praise; and let him answer them;
And may the grace of God in this assist him!"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-64">As a disciple, who his teacher follows,
Ready and willing, where he is expert,
That his proficiency may be displayed,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-67">"Hope," said I, "is the certain expectation
Of future glory, which is the effect
Of grace divine and merit precedent.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-70">From many stars this light comes unto me;
But he instilled it first into my heart
Who was chief singer unto the chief captain.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-73">'Sperent in te,' in the high Theody
He sayeth, 'those who know thy name;' and who
Knoweth it not, if he my faith possess?
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-76">Thou didst instil me, then, with his instilling
In the Epistle, so that I am full,
And upon others rain again your rain."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-79">While I was speaking, in the living bosom
Of that combustion quivered an effulgence,
Sudden and frequent, in the guise of lightning;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-82">Then breathed: "The love wherewith I am inflamed
Towards the virtue still which followed me
Unto the palm and issue of the field,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-85">Wills that I breathe to thee that thou delight
In her; and grateful to me is thy telling
Whatever things Hope promises to thee."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-88">And I: "The ancient Scriptures and the new
The mark establish, and this shows it me,
Of all the souls whom God hath made his friends.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-91">Isaiah saith, that each one garmented
In his own land shall be with twofold garments,
And his own land is this delightful life.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-94">Thy brother, too, far more explicitly,
There where he treateth of the robes of white,
This revelation manifests to us."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-97">And first, and near the ending of these words,
"Sperent in te" from over us was heard,
To which responsive answered all the carols.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-100">Thereafterward a light among them brightened,
So that, if Cancer one such crystal had,
Winter would have a month of one sole day.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-103">And as uprises, goes, and enters the dance
A winsome maiden, only to do honour
To the new bride, and not from any failing,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-106">Even thus did I behold the brightened splendour
Approach the two, who in a wheel revolved
As was beseeming to their ardent love.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-109">Into the song and music there it entered;
And fixed on them my Lady kept her look,
Even as a bride silent and motionless.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-112">"This is the one who lay upon the breast
Of him our Pelican; and this is he
To the great office from the cross elected."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-115">My Lady thus; but therefore none the more
Did move her sight from its attentive gaze
Before or afterward these words of hers.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-118">Even as a man who gazes, and endeavours
To see the eclipsing of the sun a little,
And who, by seeing, sightless doth become,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-121">So I became before that latest fire,
While it was said, "Why dost thou daze thyself
To see a thing which here hath no existence?
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-124">Earth in the earth my body is, and shall be
With all the others there, until our number
With the eternal proposition tallies.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-127">With the two garments in the blessed cloister
Are the two lights alone that have ascended:
And this shalt thou take back into your world."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-130">And at this utterance the flaming circle
Grew quiet, with the dulcet intermingling
Of sound that by the trinal breath was made,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-133">As to escape from danger or fatigue
The oars that erst were in the water beaten
Are all suspended at a whistle's sound.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-136">Ah, how much in my mind was I disturbed,
When I turned round to look on Beatrice,
That her I could not see, although I was
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxv-139">Close at her side and in the Happy World!
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XXVI

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-1">While I was doubting for my vision quenched,
Out of the flame refulgent that had quenched it
Issued a breathing, that attentive made me,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-4">Saying: "While thou recoverest the sense
Of seeing which in me thou hast consumed,
'Tis well that speaking thou shouldst compensate it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-7">Begin then, and declare to what thy soul
Is aimed, and count it for a certainty,
Sight is in thee bewildered and not dead;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-10">Because the Lady, who through this divine
Region conducteth thee, has in her look
The power the hand of Ananias had."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-13">I said: "As pleaseth her, or soon or late
Let the cure come to eyes that portals were
When she with fire I ever burn with entered.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-16">The Good, that gives contentment to this Court,
The Alpha and Omega is of all
The writing that love reads me low or loud."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-19">The selfsame voice, that taken had from me
The terror of the sudden dazzlement,
To speak still farther put it in my thought;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-22">And said: "In verity with finer sieve
Behoveth thee to sift; thee it behoveth
To say who aimed thy bow at such a target."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-25">And I: "By philosophic arguments,
And by authority that hence descends,
Such love must needs imprint itself in me;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-28">For Good, so far as good, when comprehended
Doth straight enkindle love, and so much greater
As more of goodness in itself it holds;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-31">Then to that Essence (whose is such advantage
That every good which out of it is found
Is nothing but a ray of its own light)
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-34">More than elsewhither must the mind be moved
Of every one, in loving, who discerns
The truth in which this evidence is founded.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-37">Such truth he to my intellect reveals
Who demonstrates to me the primal love
Of all the sempiternal substances.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-40">The voice reveals it of the truthful Author,
Who says to Moses, speaking of Himself,
'I will make all my goodness pass before thee.'
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-43">Thou too revealest it to me, beginning
The loud Evangel, that proclaims the secret
Of heaven to earth above all other edict."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-46">And I heard say: "By human intellect
And by authority concordant with it,
Of all thy loves reserve for God the highest.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-49">But say again if other cords thou feelest,
Draw thee towards Him, that thou mayst proclaim
With how many teeth this love is biting thee."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-52">The holy purpose of the Eagle of Christ
Not latent was, nay, rather I perceived
Whither he fain would my profession lead.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-55">Therefore I recommenced: "All of those bites
Which have the power to turn the heart to God
Unto my charity have been concurrent.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-58">The being of the world, and my own being,
The death which He endured that I may live,
And that which all the faithful hope, as I do,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-61">With the forementioned vivid consciousness
Have drawn me from the sea of love perverse,
And of the right have placed me on the shore.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-64">The leaves, wherewith embowered is all the garden
Of the Eternal Gardener, do I love
As much as he has granted them of good."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-67">As soon as I had ceased, a song most sweet
Throughout the heaven resounded, and my Lady
Said with the others, "Holy, holy, holy!"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-70">And as at some keen light one wakes from sleep
By reason of the visual spirit that runs
Unto the splendour passed from coat to coat,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-73">And he who wakes abhorreth what he sees,
So all unconscious is his sudden waking,
Until the judgment cometh to his aid,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-76">So from before mine eyes did Beatrice
Chase every mote with radiance of her own,
That cast its light a thousand miles and more.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-79">Whence better after than before I saw,
And in a kind of wonderment I asked
About a fourth light that I saw with us.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-82">And said my Lady: "There within those rays
Gazes upon its Maker the first soul
That ever the first virtue did create."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-85">Even as the bough that downward bends its top
At transit of the wind, and then is lifted
By its own virtue, which inclines it upward,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-88">Likewise did I, the while that she was speaking,
Being amazed, and then I was made bold
By a desire to speak wherewith I burned.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-91">And I began: "O apple, that mature
Alone hast been produced, O ancient father,
To whom each wife is daughter and daughter-in-law,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-94">Devoutly as I can I supplicate thee
That thou wouldst speak to me; thou seest my wish;
And I, to hear thee quickly, speak it not."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-97">Sometimes an animal, when covered, struggles
So that his impulse needs must be apparent,
By reason of the wrappage following it;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-100">And in like manner the primeval soul
Made clear to me athwart its covering
How jubilant it was to give me pleasure.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-103">Then breathed: "Without thy uttering it to me,
Thine inclination better I discern
Than thou whatever thing is surest to thee;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-106">For I behold it in the truthful mirror,
That of Himself all things parhelion makes,
And none makes Him parhelion of itself.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-109">Thou fain wouldst hear how long ago God placed me
Within the lofty garden, where this Lady
Unto so long a stairway thee disposed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-112">And how long to mine eyes it was a pleasure,
And of the great disdain the proper cause,
And the language that I used and that I made.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-115">Now, son of mine, the tasting of the tree
Not in itself was cause of so great exile,
But solely the o'erstepping of the bounds.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-118">There, whence thy Lady moved Virgilius,
Four thousand and three hundred and two circuits
Made by the sun, this Council I desired;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-121">And him I saw return to all the lights
Of his highway nine hundred times and thirty,
Whilst I upon the earth was tarrying.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-124">The language that I spake was quite extinct
Before that in the work interminable
The people under Nimrod were employed;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-127">For nevermore result of reasoning
(Because of human pleasure that doth change,
Obedient to the heavens) was durable.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-130">A natural action is it that man speaks;
But whether thus or thus, doth nature leave
To your own art, as seemeth best to you.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-133">Ere I descended to the infernal anguish,
'El' was on earth the name of the Chief Good,
From whom comes all the joy that wraps me round
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-136">'Eli' he then was called, and that is proper,
Because the use of men is like a leaf
On bough, which goeth and another cometh.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-139">Upon the mount that highest o'er the wave
Rises was I, in life or pure or sinful,
From the first hour to that which is the second,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvi-142">As the sun changes quadrant, to the sixth."
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XXVII

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-1">"Glory be to the Father, to the Son,
And Holy Ghost!" all Paradise began,
So that the melody inebriate made me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-4">What I beheld seemed unto me a smile
Of the universe; for my inebriation
Found entrance through the hearing and the sight.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-7">O joy!  O gladness inexpressible!
O perfect life of love and peacefulness!
O riches without hankering secure!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-10">Before mine eyes were standing the four torches
Enkindled, and the one that first had come
Began to make itself more luminous;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-13">And even such in semblance it became
As Jupiter would become, if he and Mars
Were birds, and they should interchange their feathers.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-16">That Providence, which here distributeth
Season and service, in the blessed choir
Had silence upon every side imposed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-19">When I heard say: "If I my colour change,
Marvel not at it; for while I am speaking
Thou shalt behold all these their colour change.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-22">He who usurps upon the earth my place,
My place, my place, which vacant has become
Before the presence of the Son of God,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-25">Has of my cemetery made a sewer
Of blood and stench, whereby the Perverse One,
Who fell from here, below there is appeased!"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-28">With the same colour which, through sun adverse,
Painteth the clouds at evening or at morn,
Beheld I then the whole of heaven suffused.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-31">And as a modest woman, who abides
Sure of herself, and at another's failing,
From listening only, timorous becomes,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-34">Even thus did Beatrice change countenance;
And I believe in heaven was such eclipse,
When suffered the supreme Omnipotence;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-37">Thereafterward proceeded forth his words
With voice so much transmuted from itself,
The very countenance was not more changed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-40">"The spouse of Christ has never nurtured been
On blood of mine, of Linus and of Cletus,
To be made use of in acquest of gold;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-43">But in acquest of this delightful life
Sixtus and Pius, Urban and Calixtus,
After much lamentation, shed their blood.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-46">Our purpose was not, that on the right hand
Of our successors should in part be seated
The Christian folk, in part upon the other;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-49">Nor that the keys which were to me confided
Should e'er become the escutcheon on a banner,
That should wage war on those who are baptized;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-52">Nor I be made the figure of a seal
To privileges venal and mendacious,
Whereat I often redden and flash with fire.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-55">In garb of shepherds the rapacious wolves
Are seen from here above o'er all the pastures!
O wrath of God, why dost thou slumber still?
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-58">To drink our blood the Caorsines and Gascons
Are making ready.  O thou good beginning,
Unto how vile an end must thou needs fall!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-61">But the high Providence, that with Scipio
At Rome the glory of the world defended,
Will speedily bring aid, as I conceive;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-64">And thou, my son, who by thy mortal weight
Shalt down return again, open thy mouth;
What I conceal not, do not thou conceal."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-67">As with its frozen vapours downward falls
In flakes our atmosphere, what time the horn
Of the celestial Goat doth touch the sun,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-70">Upward in such array saw I the ether
Become, and flaked with the triumphant vapours,
Which there together with us had remained.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-73">My sight was following up their semblances,
And followed till the medium, by excess,
The passing farther onward took from it;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-76">Whereat the Lady, who beheld me freed
From gazing upward, said to me: "Cast down
Thy sight, and see how far thou art turned round."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-79">Since the first time that I had downward looked,
I saw that I had moved through the whole arc
Which the first climate makes from midst to end;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-82">So that I saw the mad track of Ulysses
Past Gades, and this side, well nigh the shore
Whereon became Europa a sweet burden.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-85">And of this threshing-floor the site to me
Were more unveiled, but the sun was proceeding
Under my feet, a sign and more removed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-88">My mind enamoured, which is dallying
At all times with my Lady, to bring back
To her mine eyes was more than ever ardent.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-91">And if or Art or Nature has made bait
To catch the eyes and so possess the mind,
In human flesh or in its portraiture,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-94">All joined together would appear as nought
To the divine delight which shone upon me
When to her smiling face I turned me round.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-97">The virtue that her look endowed me with
From the fair nest of Leda tore me forth,
And up into the swiftest heaven impelled me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-100">Its parts exceeding full of life and lofty
Are all so uniform, I cannot say
Which Beatrice selected for my place.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-103">But she, who was aware of my desire,
Began, the while she smiled so joyously
That God seemed in her countenance to rejoice:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-106">"The nature of that motion, which keeps quiet
The centre and all the rest about it moves,
From hence begins as from its starting point.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-109">And in this heaven there is no other Where
Than in the Mind Divine, wherein is kindled
The love that turns it, and the power it rains.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-112">Within a circle light and love embrace it,
Even as this doth the others, and that precinct
He who encircles it alone controls.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-115">Its motion is not by another meted,
But all the others measured are by this,
As ten is by the half and by the fifth.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-118">And in what manner time in such a pot
May have its roots, and in the rest its leaves,
Now unto thee can manifest be made.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-121">O Covetousness, that mortals dost ingulf
Beneath thee so, that no one hath the power
Of drawing back his eyes from out thy waves!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-124">Full fairly blossoms in mankind the will;
But the uninterrupted rain converts
Into abortive wildings the true plums.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-127">Fidelity and innocence are found
Only in children; afterwards they both
Take flight or e'er the cheeks with down are covered.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-130">One, while he prattles still, observes the fasts,
Who, when his tongue is loosed, forthwith devours
Whatever food under whatever moon;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-133">Another, while he prattles, loves and listens
Unto his mother, who when speech is perfect
Forthwith desires to see her in her grave.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-136">Even thus is swarthy made the skin so white
In its first aspect of the daughter fair
Of him who brings the morn, and leaves the night.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-139">Thou, that it may not be a marvel to thee,
Think that on earth there is no one who governs;
Whence goes astray the human family.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-142">Ere January be unwintered wholly
By the centesimal on earth neglected,
Shall these supernal circles roar so loud
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-145">The tempest that has been so long awaited
Shall whirl the poops about where are the prows;
So that the fleet shall run its course direct,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxvii-148">And the true fruit shall follow on the flower."
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XXVIII

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-1">After the truth against the present life
Of miserable mortals was unfolded
By her who doth imparadise my mind,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-4">As in a looking-glass a taper's flame
He sees who from behind is lighted by it,
Before he has it in his sight or thought,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-7">And turns him round to see if so the glass
Tell him the truth, and sees that it accords
Therewith as doth a music with its metre,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-10">In similar wise my memory recollecteth
That I did, looking into those fair eyes,
Of which Love made the springes to ensnare me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-13">And as I turned me round, and mine were touched
By that which is apparent in that volume,
Whenever on its gyre we gaze intent,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-16">A point beheld I, that was raying out
Light so acute, the sight which it enkindles
Must close perforce before such great acuteness.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-19">And whatsoever star seems smallest here
Would seem to be a moon, if placed beside it.
As one star with another star is placed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-22">Perhaps at such a distance as appears
A halo cincturing the light that paints it,
When densest is the vapour that sustains it,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-25">Thus distant round the point a circle of fire
So swiftly whirled, that it would have surpassed
Whatever motion soonest girds the world;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-28">And this was by another circumcinct,
That by a third, the third then by a fourth,
By a fifth the fourth, and then by a sixth the fifth;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-31">The seventh followed thereupon in width
So ample now, that Juno's messenger
Entire would be too narrow to contain it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-34">Even so the eighth and ninth; and every one
More slowly moved, according as it was
In number distant farther from the first.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-37">And that one had its flame most crystalline
From which less distant was the stainless spark,
I think because more with its truth imbued.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-40">My Lady, who in my anxiety
Beheld me much perplexed, said: "From that point
Dependent is the heaven and nature all.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-43">Behold that circle most conjoined to it,
And know thou, that its motion is so swift
Through burning love whereby it is spurred on."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-46">And I to her: "If the world were arranged
In the order which I see in yonder wheels,
What's set before me would have satisfied me;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-49">But in the world of sense we can perceive
That evermore the circles are diviner
As they are from the centre more remote
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-52">Wherefore if my desire is to be ended
In this miraculous and angelic temple,
That has for confines only love and light,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-55">To hear behoves me still how the example
And the exemplar go not in one fashion,
Since for myself in vain I contemplate it."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-58">"If thine own fingers unto such a knot
Be insufficient, it is no great wonder,
So hard hath it become for want of trying."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-61">My Lady thus; then said she: "Do thou take
What I shall tell thee, if thou wouldst be sated,
And exercise on that thy subtlety.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-64">The circles corporal are wide and narrow
According to the more or less of virtue
Which is distributed through all their parts.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-67">The greater goodness works the greater weal,
The greater weal the greater body holds,
If perfect equally are all its parts.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-70">Therefore this one which sweeps along with it
The universe sublime, doth correspond
Unto the circle which most loves and knows.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-73">On which account, if thou unto the virtue
Apply thy measure, not to the appearance
Of substances that unto thee seem round,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-76">Thou wilt behold a marvellous agreement,
Of more to greater, and of less to smaller,
In every heaven, with its Intelligence."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-79">Even as remaineth splendid and serene
The hemisphere of air, when Boreas
Is blowing from that cheek where he is mildest,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-82">Because is purified and resolved the rack
That erst disturbed it, till the welkin laughs
With all the beauties of its pageantry;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-85">Thus did I likewise, after that my Lady
Had me provided with her clear response,
And like a star in heaven the truth was seen.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-88">And soon as to a stop her words had come,
Not otherwise does iron scintillate
When molten, than those circles scintillated.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-91">Their coruscation all the sparks repeated,
And they so many were, their number makes
More millions than the doubling of the chess.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-94">I heard them sing hosanna choir by choir
To the fixed point which holds them at the 'Ubi,'
And ever will, where they have ever been.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-97">And she, who saw the dubious meditations
Within my mind, "The primal circles," said,
"Have shown thee Seraphim and Cherubim.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-100">Thus rapidly they follow their own bonds,
To be as like the point as most they can,
And can as far as they are high in vision.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-103">Those other Loves, that round about them go,
Thrones of the countenance divine are called,
Because they terminate the primal Triad.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-106">And thou shouldst know that they all have delight
As much as their own vision penetrates
The Truth, in which all intellect finds rest.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-109">From this it may be seen how blessedness
Is founded in the faculty which sees,
And not in that which loves, and follows next;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-112">And of this seeing merit is the measure,
Which is brought forth by grace, and by good will;
Thus on from grade to grade doth it proceed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-115">The second Triad, which is germinating
In such wise in this sempiternal spring,
That no nocturnal Aries despoils,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-118">Perpetually hosanna warbles forth
With threefold melody, that sounds in three
Orders of joy, with which it is intrined.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-121">The three Divine are in this hierarchy,
First the Dominions, and the Virtues next;
And the third order is that of the Powers.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-124">Then in the dances twain penultimate
The Principalities and Archangels wheel;
The last is wholly of angelic sports.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-127">These orders upward all of them are gazing,
And downward so prevail, that unto God
They all attracted are and all attract.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-130">And Dionysius with so great desire
To contemplate these Orders set himself,
He named them and distinguished them as I do.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-133">But Gregory afterwards dissented from him;
Wherefore, as soon as he unclosed his eyes
Within this heaven, he at himself did smile.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-136">And if so much of secret truth a mortal
Proffered on earth, I would not have thee marvel,
For he who saw it here revealed it to him,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxviii-139">With much more of the truth about these circles."
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XXIX

<p id="paradiso-xxix-1">At what time both the children of Latona,
Surmounted by the Ram and by the Scales,
Together make a zone of the horizon,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-4">As long as from the time the zenith holds them
In equipoise, till from that girdle both
Changing their hemisphere disturb the balance,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-7">So long, her face depicted with a smile,
Did Beatrice keep silence while she gazed
Fixedly at the point which had o'ercome me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-10">Then she began: "I say, and I ask not
What thou dost wish to hear, for I have seen it
Where centres every When and every 'Ubi.'
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-13">Not to acquire some good unto himself,
Which is impossible, but that his splendour
In its resplendency may say, 'Subsisto,'
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-16">In his eternity outside of time,
Outside all other limits, as it pleased him,
Into new Loves the Eternal Love unfolded.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-19">Nor as if torpid did he lie before;
For neither after nor before proceeded
The going forth of God upon these waters.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-22">Matter and Form unmingled and conjoined
Came into being that had no defect,
E'en as three arrows from a three-stringed bow.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-25">And as in glass, in amber, or in crystal
A sunbeam flashes so, that from its coming
To its full being is no interval,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-28">So from its Lord did the triform effect
Ray forth into its being all together,
Without discrimination of beginning.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-31">Order was con-created and constructed
In substances, and summit of the world
Were those wherein the pure act was produced.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-34">Pure potentiality held the lowest part;
Midway bound potentiality with act
Such bond that it shall never be unbound.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-37">Jerome has written unto you of angels
Created a long lapse of centuries
Or ever yet the other world was made;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-40">But written is this truth in many places
By writers of the Holy Ghost, and thou
Shalt see it, if thou lookest well thereat.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-43">And even reason seeth it somewhat,
For it would not concede that for so long
Could be the motors without their perfection.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-46">Now dost thou know both where and when these Loves
Created were, and how; so that extinct
In thy desire already are three fires.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-49">Nor could one reach, in counting, unto twenty
So swiftly, as a portion of these angels
Disturbed the subject of your elements.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-52">The rest remained, and they began this art
Which thou discernest, with so great delight
That never from their circling do they cease.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-55">The occasion of the fall was the accursed
Presumption of that One, whom thou hast seen
By all the burden of the world constrained.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-58">Those whom thou here beholdest modest were
To recognise themselves as of that goodness
Which made them apt for so much understanding;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-61">On which account their vision was exalted
By the enlightening grace and their own merit,
So that they have a full and steadfast will.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-64">I would not have thee doubt, but certain be,
'Tis meritorious to receive this grace,
According as the affection opens to it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-67">Now round about in this consistory
Much mayst thou contemplate, if these my words
Be gathered up, without all further aid.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-70">But since upon the earth, throughout your schools,
They teach that such is the angelic nature
That it doth hear, and recollect, and will,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-73">More will I say, that thou mayst see unmixed
The truth that is confounded there below,
Equivocating in such like prelections.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-76">These substances, since in God's countenance
They jocund were, turned not away their sight
From that wherefrom not anything is hidden;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-79">Hence they have not their vision intercepted
By object new, and hence they do not need
To recollect, through interrupted thought.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-82">So that below, not sleeping, people dream,
Believing they speak truth, and not believing;
And in the last is greater sin and shame.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-85">Below you do not journey by one path
Philosophising; so transporteth you
Love of appearance and the thought thereof.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-88">And even this above here is endured
With less disdain, than when is set aside
The Holy Writ, or when it is distorted.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-91">They think not there how much of blood it costs
To sow it in the world, and how he pleases
Who in humility keeps close to it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-94">Each striveth for appearance, and doth make
His own inventions; and these treated are
By preachers, and the Evangel holds its peace.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-97">One sayeth that the moon did backward turn,
In the Passion of Christ, and interpose herself
So that the sunlight reached not down below;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-100">And lies; for of its own accord the light
Hid itself; whence to Spaniards and to Indians,
As to the Jews, did such eclipse respond.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-103">Florence has not so many Lapi and Bindi
As fables such as these, that every year
Are shouted from the pulpit back and forth,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-106">In such wise that the lambs, who do not know,
Come back from pasture fed upon the wind,
And not to see the harm doth not excuse them.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-109">Christ did not to his first disciples say,
'Go forth, and to the world preach idle tales,'
But unto them a true foundation gave;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-112">And this so loudly sounded from their lips,
That, in the warfare to enkindle Faith,
They made of the Evangel shields and lances.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-115">Now men go forth with jests and drolleries
To preach, and if but well the people laugh,
The hood puffs out, and nothing more is asked.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-118">But in the cowl there nestles such a bird,
That, if the common people were to see it,
They would perceive what pardons they confide in,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-121">For which so great on earth has grown the folly,
That, without proof of any testimony,
To each indulgence they would flock together.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-124">By this Saint Anthony his pig doth fatten,
And many others, who are worse than pigs,
Paying in money without mark of coinage.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-127">But since we have digressed abundantly,
Turn back thine eyes forthwith to the right path,
So that the way be shortened with the time.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-130">This nature doth so multiply itself
In numbers, that there never yet was speech
Nor mortal fancy that can go so far.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-133">And if thou notest that which is revealed
By Daniel, thou wilt see that in his thousands
Number determinate is kept concealed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-136">The primal light, that all irradiates it,
By modes as many is received therein,
As are the splendours wherewith it is mated.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-139">Hence, inasmuch as on the act conceptive
The affection followeth, of love the sweetness
Therein diversely fervid is or tepid.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-142">The height behold now and the amplitude
Of the eternal power, since it hath made
Itself so many mirrors, where 'tis broken,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxix-145">One in itself remaining as before."
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XXX

<p id="paradiso-xxx-1">Perchance six thousand miles remote from us
Is glowing the sixth hour, and now this world
Inclines its shadow almost to a level,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-4">When the mid-heaven begins to make itself
So deep to us, that here and there a star
Ceases to shine so far down as this depth,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-7">And as advances bright exceedingly
The handmaid of the sun, the heaven is closed
Light after light to the most beautiful;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-10">Not otherwise the Triumph, which for ever
Plays round about the point that vanquished me,
Seeming enclosed by what itself encloses,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-13">Little by little from my vision faded;
Whereat to turn mine eyes on Beatrice
My seeing nothing and my love constrained me.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-16">If what has hitherto been said of her
Were all concluded in a single praise,
Scant would it be to serve the present turn.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-19">Not only does the beauty I beheld
Transcend ourselves, but truly I believe
Its Maker only may enjoy it all.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-22">Vanquished do I confess me by this passage
More than by problem of his theme was ever
O'ercome the comic or the tragic poet;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-25">For as the sun the sight that trembles most,
Even so the memory of that sweet smile
My mind depriveth of its very self.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-28">From the first day that I beheld her face
In this life, to the moment of this look,
The sequence of my song has ne'er been severed;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-31">But now perforce this sequence must desist
From following her beauty with my verse,
As every artist at his uttermost.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-34">Such as I leave her to a greater fame
Than any of my trumpet, which is bringing
Its arduous matter to a final close,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-37">With voice and gesture of a perfect leader
She recommenced: "We from the greatest body
Have issued to the heaven that is pure light;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-40">Light intellectual replete with love,
Love of true good replete with ecstasy,
Ecstasy that transcendeth every sweetness.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-43">Here shalt thou see the one host and the other
Of Paradise, and one in the same aspects
Which at the final judgment thou shalt see."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-46">Even as a sudden lightning that disperses
The visual spirits, so that it deprives
The eye of impress from the strongest objects,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-49">Thus round about me flashed a living light,
And left me swathed around with such a veil
Of its effulgence, that I nothing saw.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-52">"Ever the Love which quieteth this heaven
Welcomes into itself with such salute,
To make the candle ready for its flame."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-55">No sooner had within me these brief words
An entrance found, than I perceived myself
To be uplifted over my own power,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-58">And I with vision new rekindled me,
Such that no light whatever is so pure
But that mine eyes were fortified against it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-61">And light I saw in fashion of a river
Fulvid with its effulgence, 'twixt two banks
Depicted with an admirable Spring.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-64">Out of this river issued living sparks,
And on all sides sank down into the flowers,
Like unto rubies that are set in gold;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-67">And then, as if inebriate with the odours,
They plunged again into the wondrous torrent,
And as one entered issued forth another.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-70">"The high desire, that now inflames and moves thee
To have intelligence of what thou seest,
Pleaseth me all the more, the more it swells.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-73">But of this water it behoves thee drink
Before so great a thirst in thee be slaked."
Thus said to me the sunshine of mine eyes;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-76">And added: "The river and the topazes
Going in and out, and the laughing of the herbage,
Are of their truth foreshadowing prefaces;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-79">Not that these things are difficult in themselves,
But the deficiency is on thy side,
For yet thou hast not vision so exalted."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-82">There is no babe that leaps so suddenly
With face towards the milk, if he awake
Much later than his usual custom is,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-85">As I did, that I might make better mirrors
Still of mine eyes, down stooping to the wave
Which flows that we therein be better made.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-88">And even as the penthouse of mine eyelids
Drank of it, it forthwith appeared to me
Out of its length to be transformed to round.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-91">Then as a folk who have been under masks
Seem other than before, if they divest
The semblance not their own they disappeared in,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-94">Thus into greater pomp were changed for me
The flowerets and the sparks, so that I saw
Both of the Courts of Heaven made manifest.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-97">O splendour of God! by means of which I saw
The lofty triumph of the realm veracious,
Give me the power to say how it I saw!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-100">There is a light above, which visible
Makes the Creator unto every creature,
Who only in beholding Him has peace,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-103">And it expands itself in circular form
To such extent, that its circumference
Would be too large a girdle for the sun.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-106">The semblance of it is all made of rays
Reflected from the top of Primal Motion,
Which takes therefrom vitality and power.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-109">And as a hill in water at its base
Mirrors itself, as if to see its beauty
When affluent most in verdure and in flowers,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-112">So, ranged aloft all round about the light,
Mirrored I saw in more ranks than a thousand
All who above there have from us returned.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-115">And if the lowest row collect within it
So great a light, how vast the amplitude
Is of this Rose in its extremest leaves!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-118">My vision in the vastness and the height
Lost not itself, but comprehended all
The quantity and quality of that gladness.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-121">There near and far nor add nor take away;
For there where God immediately doth govern,
The natural law in naught is relevant.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-124">Into the yellow of the Rose Eternal
That spreads, and multiplies, and breathes an odour
Of praise unto the ever-vernal Sun,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-127">As one who silent is and fain would speak,
Me Beatrice drew on, and said: "Behold
Of the white stoles how vast the convent is!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-130">Behold how vast the circuit of our city!
Behold our seats so filled to overflowing,
That here henceforward are few people wanting!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-133">On that great throne whereon thine eyes are fixed
For the crown's sake already placed upon it,
Before thou suppest at this wedding feast
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-136">Shall sit the soul (that is to be Augustus
On earth) of noble Henry, who shall come
To redress Italy ere she be ready.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-139">Blind covetousness, that casts its spell upon you,
Has made you like unto the little child,
Who dies of hunger and drives off the nurse.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-142">And in the sacred forum then shall be
A Prefect such, that openly or covert
On the same road he will not walk with him.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-145">But long of God he will not be endured
In holy office; he shall be thrust down
Where Simon Magus is for his deserts,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxx-148">And make him of Alagna lower go!"
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XXXI

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-1">In fashion then as of a snow-white rose
Displayed itself to me the saintly host,
Whom Christ in his own blood had made his bride,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-4">But the other host, that flying sees and sings
The glory of Him who doth enamour it,
And the goodness that created it so noble,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-7">Even as a swarm of bees, that sinks in flowers
One moment, and the next returns again
To where its labour is to sweetness turned,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-10">Sank into the great flower, that is adorned
With leaves so many, and thence reascended
To where its love abideth evermore.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-13">Their faces had they all of living flame,
And wings of gold, and all the rest so white
No snow unto that limit doth attain.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-16">From bench to bench, into the flower descending,
They carried something of the peace and ardour
Which by the fanning of their flanks they won.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-19">Nor did the interposing 'twixt the flower
And what was o'er it of such plenitude
Of flying shapes impede the sight and splendour;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-22">Because the light divine so penetrates
The universe, according to its merit,
That naught can be an obstacle against it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-25">This realm secure and full of gladsomeness,
Crowded with ancient people and with modern,
Unto one mark had all its look and love.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-28">O Trinal Light, that in a single star
Sparkling upon their sight so satisfies them,
Look down upon our tempest here below!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-31">If the barbarians, coming from some region
That every day by Helice is covered,
Revolving with her son whom she delights in,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-34">Beholding Rome and all her noble works,
Were wonder-struck, what time the Lateran
Above all mortal things was eminent,--
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-37">I who to the divine had from the human,
From time unto eternity, had come,
From Florence to a people just and sane,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-40">With what amazement must I have been filled!
Truly between this and the joy, it was
My pleasure not to hear, and to be mute.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-43">And as a pilgrim who delighteth him
In gazing round the temple of his vow,
And hopes some day to retell how it was,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-46">So through the living light my way pursuing
Directed I mine eyes o'er all the ranks,
Now up, now down, and now all round about.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-49">Faces I saw of charity persuasive,
Embellished by His light and their own smile,
And attitudes adorned with every grace.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-52">The general form of Paradise already
My glance had comprehended as a whole,
In no part hitherto remaining fixed,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-55">And round I turned me with rekindled wish
My Lady to interrogate of things
Concerning which my mind was in suspense.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-58">One thing I meant, another answered me;
I thought I should see Beatrice, and saw
An Old Man habited like the glorious people.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-61">O'erflowing was he in his eyes and cheeks
With joy benign, in attitude of pity
As to a tender father is becoming.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-64">And "She, where is she?" instantly I said;
Whence he: "To put an end to thy desire,
Me Beatrice hath sent from mine own place.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-67">And if thou lookest up to the third round
Of the first rank, again shalt thou behold her
Upon the throne her merits have assigned her."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-70">Without reply I lifted up mine eyes,
And saw her, as she made herself a crown
Reflecting from herself the eternal rays.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-73">Not from that region which the highest thunders
Is any mortal eye so far removed,
In whatsoever sea it deepest sinks,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-76">As there from Beatrice my sight; but this
Was nothing unto me; because her image
Descended not to me by medium blurred.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-79">"O Lady, thou in whom my hope is strong,
And who for my salvation didst endure
In Hell to leave the imprint of thy feet,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-82">Of whatsoever things I have beheld,
As coming from thy power and from thy goodness
I recognise the virtue and the grace.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-85">Thou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom,
By all those ways, by all the expedients,
Whereby thou hadst the power of doing it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-88">Preserve towards me thy magnificence,
So that this soul of mine, which thou hast healed,
Pleasing to thee be loosened from the body."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-91">Thus I implored; and she, so far away,
Smiled, as it seemed, and looked once more at me;
Then unto the eternal fountain turned.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-94">And said the Old Man holy: "That thou mayst
Accomplish perfectly thy journeying,
Whereunto prayer and holy love have sent me,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-97">Fly with thine eyes all round about this garden;
For seeing it will discipline thy sight
Farther to mount along the ray divine.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-100">And she, the Queen of Heaven, for whom I burn
Wholly with love, will grant us every grace,
Because that I her faithful Bernard am."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-103">As he who peradventure from Croatia
Cometh to gaze at our Veronica,
Who through its ancient fame is never sated,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-106">But says in thought, the while it is displayed,
"My Lord, Christ Jesus, God of very God,
Now was your semblance made like unto this?"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-109">Even such was I while gazing at the living
Charity of the man, who in this world
By contemplation tasted of that peace.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-112">"Thou son of grace, this jocund life," began he,
"Will not be known to thee by keeping ever
Thine eyes below here on the lowest place;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-115">But mark the circles to the most remote,
Until thou shalt behold enthroned the Queen
To whom this realm is subject and devoted."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-118">I lifted up mine eyes, and as at morn
The oriental part of the horizon
Surpasses that wherein the sun goes down,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-121">Thus, as if going with mine eyes from vale
To mount, I saw a part in the remoteness
Surpass in splendour all the other front.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-124">And even as there where we await the pole
That Phaeton drove badly, blazes more
The light, and is on either side diminished,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-127">So likewise that pacific oriflamme
Gleamed brightest in the centre, and each side
In equal measure did the flame abate.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-130">And at that centre, with their wings expanded,
More than a thousand jubilant Angels saw I,
Each differing in effulgence and in kind.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-133">I saw there at their sports and at their songs
A beauty smiling, which the gladness was
Within the eyes of all the other saints;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-136">And if I had in speaking as much wealth
As in imagining, I should not dare
To attempt the smallest part of its delight.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-139">Bernard, as soon as he beheld mine eyes
Fixed and intent upon its fervid fervour,
His own with such affection turned to her
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxi-142">That it made mine more ardent to behold.
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XXXII

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-1">Absorbed in his delight, that contemplator
Assumed the willing office of a teacher,
And gave beginning to these holy words:
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-4">"The wound that Mary closed up and anointed,
She at her feet who is so beautiful,
She is the one who opened it and pierced it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-7">Within that order which the third seats make
Is seated Rachel, lower than the other,
With Beatrice, in manner as thou seest.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-10">Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, and her who was
Ancestress of the Singer, who for dole
Of the misdeed said, 'Miserere mei,'
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-13">Canst thou behold from seat to seat descending
Down in gradation, as with each one's name
I through the Rose go down from leaf to leaf.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-16">And downward from the seventh row, even as
Above the same, succeed the Hebrew women,
Dividing all the tresses of the flower;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-19">Because, according to the view which Faith
In Christ had taken, these are the partition
By which the sacred stairways are divided.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-22">Upon this side, where perfect is the flower
With each one of its petals, seated are
Those who believed in Christ who was to come.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-25">Upon the other side, where intersected
With vacant spaces are the semicircles,
Are those who looked to Christ already come.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-28">And as, upon this side, the glorious seat
Of the Lady of Heaven, and the other seats
Below it, such a great division make,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-31">So opposite doth that of the great John,
Who, ever holy, desert and martyrdom
Endured, and afterwards two years in Hell.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-34">And under him thus to divide were chosen
Francis, and Benedict, and Augustine,
And down to us the rest from round to round.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-37">Behold now the high providence divine;
For one and other aspect of the Faith
In equal measure shall this garden fill.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-40">And know that downward from that rank which cleaves
Midway the sequence of the two divisions,
Not by their proper merit are they seated;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-43">But by another's under fixed conditions;
For these are spirits one and all assoiled
Before they any true election had.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-46">Well canst thou recognise it in their faces,
And also in their voices puerile,
If thou regard them well and hearken to them.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-49">Now doubtest thou, and doubting thou art silent;
But I will loosen for thee the strong bond
In which thy subtile fancies hold thee fast.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-52">Within the amplitude of this domain
No casual point can possibly find place,
No more than sadness can, or thirst, or hunger;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-55">For by eternal law has been established
Whatever thou beholdest, so that closely
The ring is fitted to the finger here.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-58">And therefore are these people, festinate
Unto true life, not 'sine causa' here
More and less excellent among themselves.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-61">The King, by means of whom this realm reposes
In so great love and in so great delight
That no will ventureth to ask for more,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-64">In his own joyous aspect every mind
Creating, at his pleasure dowers with grace
Diversely; and let here the effect suffice.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-67">And this is clearly and expressly noted
For you in Holy Scripture, in those twins
Who in their mother had their anger roused.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-70">According to the colour of the hair,
Therefore, with such a grace the light supreme
Consenteth that they worthily be crowned.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-73">Without, then, any merit of their deeds,
Stationed are they in different gradations,
Differing only in their first acuteness.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-76">'Tis true that in the early centuries,
With innocence, to work out their salvation
Sufficient was the faith of parents only.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-79">After the earlier ages were completed,
Behoved it that the males by circumcision
Unto their innocent wings should virtue add;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-82">But after that the time of grace had come
Without the baptism absolute of Christ,
Such innocence below there was retained.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-85">Look now into the face that unto Christ
Hath most resemblance; for its brightness only
Is able to prepare thee to see Christ."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-88">On her did I behold so great a gladness
Rain down, borne onward in the holy minds
Created through that altitude to fly,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-91">That whatsoever I had seen before
Did not suspend me in such admiration,
Nor show me such similitude of God.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-94">And the same Love that first descended there,
"Ave Maria, gratia plena," singing,
In front of her his wings expanded wide.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-97">Unto the canticle divine responded
From every part the court beatified,
So that each sight became serener for it.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-100">"O holy father, who for me endurest
To be below here, leaving the sweet place
In which thou sittest by eternal lot,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-103">Who is the Angel that with so much joy
Into the eyes is looking of our Queen,
Enamoured so that he seems made of fire?"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-106">Thus I again recourse had to the teaching
Of that one who delighted him in Mary
As doth the star of morning in the sun.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-109">And he to me: "Such gallantry and grace
As there can be in Angel and in soul,
All is in him; and thus we fain would have it;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-112">Because he is the one who bore the palm
Down unto Mary, when the Son of God
To take our burden on himself decreed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-115">But now come onward with thine eyes, as I
Speaking shall go, and note the great patricians
Of this most just and merciful of empires.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-118">Those two that sit above there most enrapture
As being very near unto Augusta,
Are as it were the two roots of this Rose.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-121">He who upon the left is near her placed
The father is, by whose audacious taste
The human species so much bitter tastes.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-124">Upon the right thou seest that ancient father
Of Holy Church, into whose keeping Christ
The keys committed of this lovely flower.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-127">And he who all the evil days beheld,
Before his death, of her the beauteous bride
Who with the spear and with the nails was won,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-130">Beside him sits, and by the other rests
That leader under whom on manna lived
The people ingrate, fickle, and stiff-necked.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-133">Opposite Peter seest thou Anna seated,
So well content to look upon her daughter,
Her eyes she moves not while she sings Hosanna.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-136">And opposite the eldest household father
Lucia sits, she who thy Lady moved
When to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-139">But since the moments of thy vision fly,
Here will we make full stop, as a good tailor
Who makes the gown according to his cloth,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-142">And unto the first Love will turn our eyes,
That looking upon Him thou penetrate
As far as possible through his effulgence.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-145">Truly, lest peradventure thou recede,
Moving thy wings believing to advance,
By prayer behoves it that grace be obtained;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-148">Grace from that one who has the power to aid thee;
And thou shalt follow me with thy affection
That from my words thy heart turn not aside."
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxii-151">And he began this holy orison.
</p>

## Paradiso - Canto XXXIII

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-1">"Thou Virgin Mother, daughter of thy Son,
Humble and high beyond all other creature,
The limit fixed of the eternal counsel,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-4">Thou art the one who such nobility
To human nature gave, that its Creator
Did not disdain to make himself its creature.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-7">Within thy womb rekindled was the love,
By heat of which in the eternal peace
After such wise this flower has germinated.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-10">Here unto us thou art a noonday torch
Of charity, and below there among mortals
Thou art the living fountain-head of hope.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-13">Lady, thou art so great, and so prevailing,
That he who wishes grace, nor runs to thee,
His aspirations without wings would fly.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-16">Not only thy benignity gives succour
To him who asketh it, but oftentimes
Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-19">In thee compassion is, in thee is pity,
In thee magnificence; in thee unites
Whate'er of goodness is in any creature.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-22">Now doth this man, who from the lowest depth
Of the universe as far as here has seen
One after one the spiritual lives,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-25">Supplicate thee through grace for so much power
That with his eyes he may uplift himself
Higher towards the uttermost salvation.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-28">And I, who never burned for my own seeing
More than I do for his, all of my prayers
Proffer to thee, and pray they come not short,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-31">That thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud
Of his mortality so with thy prayers,
That the Chief Pleasure be to him displayed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-34">Still farther do I pray thee, Queen, who canst
Whate'er thou wilt, that sound thou mayst preserve
After so great a vision his affections.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-37">Let thy protection conquer human movements;
See Beatrice and all the blessed ones
My prayers to second clasp their hands to thee!"
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-40">The eyes beloved and revered of God,
Fastened upon the speaker, showed to us
How grateful unto her are prayers devout;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-43">Then unto the Eternal Light they turned,
On which it is not credible could be
By any creature bent an eye so clear.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-46">And I, who to the end of all desires
Was now approaching, even as I ought
The ardour of desire within me ended.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-49">Bernard was beckoning unto me, and smiling,
That I should upward look; but I already
Was of my own accord such as he wished;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-52">Because my sight, becoming purified,
Was entering more and more into the ray
Of the High Light which of itself is true.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-55">From that time forward what I saw was greater
Than our discourse, that to such vision yields,
And yields the memory unto such excess.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-58">Even as he is who seeth in a dream,
And after dreaming the imprinted passion
Remains, and to his mind the rest returns not,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-61">Even such am I, for almost utterly
Ceases my vision, and distilleth yet
Within my heart the sweetness born of it;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-64">Even thus the snow is in the sun unsealed,
Even thus upon the wind in the light leaves
Were the soothsayings of the Sibyl lost.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-67">O Light Supreme, that dost so far uplift thee
From the conceits of mortals, to my mind
Of what thou didst appear re-lend a little,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-70">And make my tongue of so great puissance,
That but a single sparkle of thy glory
It may bequeath unto the future people;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-73">For by returning to my memory somewhat,
And by a little sounding in these verses,
More of thy victory shall be conceived!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-76">I think the keenness of the living ray
Which I endured would have bewildered me,
If but mine eyes had been averted from it;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-79">And I remember that I was more bold
On this account to bear, so that I joined
My aspect with the Glory Infinite.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-82">O grace abundant, by which I presumed
To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal,
So that the seeing I consumed therein!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-85">I saw that in its depth far down is lying
Bound up with love together in one volume,
What through the universe in leaves is scattered;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-88">Substance, and accident, and their operations,
All interfused together in such wise
That what I speak of is one simple light.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-91">The universal fashion of this knot
Methinks I saw, since more abundantly
In saying this I feel that I rejoice.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-94">One moment is more lethargy to me,
Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise
That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-97">My mind in this wise wholly in suspense,
Steadfast, immovable, attentive gazed,
And evermore with gazing grew enkindled.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-100">In presence of that light one such becomes,
That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect
It is impossible he e'er consent;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-103">Because the good, which object is of will,
Is gathered all in this, and out of it
That is defective which is perfect there.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-106">Shorter henceforward will my language fall
Of what I yet remember, than an infant's
Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-109">Not because more than one unmingled semblance
Was in the living light on which I looked,
For it is always what it was before;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-112">But through the sight, that fortified itself
In me by looking, one appearance only
To me was ever changing as I changed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-115">Within the deep and luminous subsistence
Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,
Of threefold colour and of one dimension,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-118">And by the second seemed the first reflected
As Iris is by Iris, and the third
Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-121">O how all speech is feeble and falls short
Of my conceit, and this to what I saw
Is such, 'tis not enough to call it little!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-124">O Light Eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest,
Sole knowest thyself, and, known unto thyself
And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself!
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-127">That circulation, which being thus conceived
Appeared in thee as a reflected light,
When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-130">Within itself, of its own very colour
Seemed to me painted with our effigy,
Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-133">As the geometrician, who endeavours
To square the circle, and discovers not,
By taking thought, the principle he wants,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-136">Even such was I at that new apparition;
I wished to see how the image to the circle
Conformed itself, and how it there finds place;
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-139">But my own wings were not enough for this,
Had it not been that then my mind there smote
A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish.
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-142">Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy:
But now was turning my desire and will,
Even as a wheel that equally is moved,
</p>

<p id="paradiso-xxxiii-145">The Love which moves the sun and the other stars.
</p>
